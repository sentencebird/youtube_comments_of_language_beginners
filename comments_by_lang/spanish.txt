hola señor Respected Sir/Madam, 

I paid for the certified TESOL course from Hello English App. It showed me 33% discount. And the course price is 5,000 (with 33% discount). But when I completed the payment it deducted 7,500 Rs. Instead of 5,000. Please check and let me know. I am so nervous. And, I am also not getting study material. Is this fake link? If yes. Please, refund the amount. I am waiting for your reply. Thank you. Wowww!

Love to learn Spanish..it's very nice good and easy to learn..gracias querido ❤😄 Started to learn Spanish today.. Anybody from Nepal? I love it thank you so much good lesson, except that the teacher has a US accent, an accent that is shared by the people who are descendant from native spanish speakers but raised in the US. This people and their accent are commonly called "Hispanos". In all fairness although fully communicative this accent is quiet funny for other spanish speakers. Hola ..
