hola señor Respected Sir/Madam, 

I paid for the certified TESOL course from Hello English App. It showed me 33% discount. And the course price is 5,000 (with 33% discount). But when I completed the payment it deducted 7,500 Rs.

Love to learn Spanish..it's very nice good and easy to learn..gracias querido ❤😄 Started to learn Spanish today.. Anybody from Nepal? I love it thank you so much good lesson, except that the teacher has a US accent, an accent that is shared by the people who are descendant from native spanish speakers but raised in the US. This people and their accent are commonly called "Hispanos". In all fairness although fully communicative this accent is quiet funny for other spanish speakers. Hola ..

Her smiling expression, made my day.😅 Why are you so cute It's buenos dias. But then it's buenas tardes. Why 'os' and 'as'? Why not both greeting use buenos or buenas? She talks too fast Anyone from india?🇮🇳
¿Alguien de la India?
Or just me?
¿O solo yo? Thank you!!! i want learn spanish because i love mexico i am from saudi arabia 🇸🇦 you should add the real meaning of the words, yes "de nada" refers to "You're welcome" but the proper meaning of the word is "its nothing" It’s always good to watch Spanish videos  to help us become fluent in Spanish on the ones that are learning Spanish because that’s how we learn👍 Is it Latin American spanish similar to espanol Gracias Como puedo decir en ingles: "No hay de que, son no mas de papa" I like your laughing

Es hora de comer 🍽😋 The nice lady really overestimated my ability when she pulled out part 2 of phrase 12! I couldnt say it the formal way, the informal was no easier 😂 where does the “F” sound come from in the last word? Me llamo un mj Yo soy mj Nicely explained... Muchas Gracias Ma'am 👌👌👌 it sounds easy when you're a Filipino. <3 Thanks so much. I really enjoyed it. Mucho gracias let's be real, this girl gives you more motivation to click the video She's great but would be even better if she slowed down a bit:) Yo he estado familiarizado con el ingles desde pequeño y considero que el español puede llegar hacer un poco difícil ya que contiene muchos sustantivos pero todo es envase a la practica Rosa has the most beautiful smile in the world.Muy Bonita yo puedo harblar espanol Mi Nobre Es Alishba Must know?

Same channel says Perdon as excuse me and sorry.. Also, instead of saying encantado de conocerle, you can say mucho gusto, which is way more common and informal. Actually, Yo soy rosa is not correct. Soy means I am, so adding yo, meaning I, is like saying I I'm Rosa. But no worries! I enjoyed your teaching soooo cutee Maaaaam Lucy is good for if🙄 lala Who are watching.

Si means yes Thanks Rosa💗 Muchas Gracias🖤 la professora es guapa This girl is so happy and made me happy!! Yo soy Rupal Do I have to laugh after every phrase I say in Spanish?

You should know the language of the country your're going to." ???? What is this hypocrisy less than two minutes into the video lol?

Good luck for all of you❤ I’m Mexican and for some reason my parents never taught me Spanish so I’m trying to learn to stop being an outcast pod101 is great. I used it for hindi "Tus vacaciones no pueden ser tan aburridas"
Yo en mis vacaciones:

My family is from mexico Buen trabajo👍 Hola yo hablo español no se hablar inglés pero estoy aprendiendo Soy nativo hablando español, alguien para conversar? Igual ando aprendiendo inglés Rosa has such a nice way about her 😊 I was doing good until they started throwing in the questions all in Spanish. I'm no where near able to answer those yet. El que quiera practicar conmigo puede hacerlo. Los ire corrigiendo  si tienen dudas.

If you want  to practice  you can tell me, i would  fix your mistakes if you have any. Let the Spanish learn English.
All an American needs to know how to say are:
1) "Hey! Those hubcaps belong to ME!"; and
2) "Go back where you came from". At this rate of anime growth, Japanese is gonna take over Spanish 😆 Anyone here because they visited Miami and didn’t understand anyone? 😅 God and Jesus love you so much Wooow eso ya es español avanzado Spanish is not in any way the second most spoken language Why's the English host American? Gracia's 🖤 Spanish homework? DM $$ 
👀😬 its actually 1 am here and i randomly decided to learn Spanish after getting an ad for Mcdonalds in spanish Trying to learn Spanish cause its 3:00 a.m and I'm drunk out of my freaking mind Learning Spanish lol 95% of this videos is these two speaking English hah, i didnt know days of the week were capitilized in english and thats my native language... Honestly surprised how much of my highschool Spanish stuck when 47:05 hit. Understood it despite not having done Spanish is 6 years. However, I barely remember how to speak it. Me one day for no reason: 3 languages ain't enough, I need to learn one more. I'm practicing English, i could help another person who would like to learn Spanish in exchange of  helping me with the English, i mean, both  listening and speaking El latín fue la lengua de la antigua Roma y en la Edad Media tuvo su mayor difusión y prestigio cultural. El engrandecimiento de Roma hizo posible esta difusión. Hoy día, la lengua neolatina más sonora es el italiano, por la abundancia de vocales. Sin embargo, este idioma continúa empleando la doble z, la doble t, etc. El francés por su parte utiliza mucho la pronunciación con acento agudo y palabras multiacentuadas. Contrariamente, el inglés omite este acento ortográfico.  El español es, por tanto, la más evolucionada y ponderada de las lenguas actuales. Su gramática es bastante completa y fonéticamente goza de una gran sonoridad y claridad. Tiene uniformidad de timbre y sus muchas palabras permiten la libre construcción. Una vocal española permanece igual mientras dura su pronunciación. No se producen, por tanto, vocales apagadas o de timbre indeciso, tan peculiares del inglés. EL IDIOMA ESPAÑOL ES UNO DE LOS MAYORES TESOROS CULTURALES. Hola a todos jajaja nadie:
 yo que hablo español viendo el video: soy el crack 😎 this was great! Preguntame lo que quieras  saber de argentina o/y paraguay ? Jajaja porque quieren estudiar espanish? 
Mira a mi yo estudio ingles y nisiquiera se hablar una minga 😂😂😂 This is really beneficial I want to learn spanish so bad!!! Im in love with latin cultures❤ yo hablo español y es mas facil Gracias por este video i just wanna speak another language to see what my neighbors are saying about me lol Y yo acá con mi idioma nativo sin saber que era un diptongo 😆 Spanish speaker: “English speakers don’t have a rolled R”

Scotland: “Hold mah’ bee’uhrr” i'm a filipino and our language  "tagalog" came from spanish, there are lots of words that are same or quiet the same..so this is easy for us to learn.😊 Muchas gracias

I am an Indian man just learning Spanish because its fun

Thank You For all your support ! I tried this when I was sleeping, it's really amazing This ain’t fair I can only dream in Spanish Hola!
I remember when I first wanted to learn spanish.
I was on a trip to Puerto Rico and it was amazing but I had a difficult time communicating with the locals. 
I thought it'd be really helpful to learn the basics so my trip could be much smoother. It's amazing because after I took this course I went to Mexico and the natives were so impressed with how well I spoke!   
Here's the course that really helped me as a beginner. I can now (with confidence) speak spanish fluently!
https://www.digistore24.com/redir/380175/laura_426/ How I suppose to sleep with the commercials? That is stupid. If you are scroling let me tell you this video is great and you should keep studying spanish!!! also, play with apps like duo or LangLandia, it's what worked for me!!! try it and stop scroling haha Everyone that was worried about waking up and only speaking Spanish rest assured, I did this and I didn’t wake up speaking Spanish. But now, for some reason I advertise to my family in English every few minutes.

Don’t put ads on something designed to listen to while you sleep. X I really hope this works I have three apps and wat more books to count and still can’t learn it I really want to learn the language so I can talk to my friends in Spanish and stuff like that so if any of y’all have any thing to help I would love for the advice please I appreciate the fact that people are making videos like this but when they insert ads into things that you're supposed to do while you're sleeping I can't sleep through a commercial To learn this quarantine, I used videos like this and a game called LangLandia. It's great and I learned a lot, I highly recommend it. With all the advertisements definitely not for sleeping. I understand commercials are necessary for income. however at the beginning or end would be preferable rather than trying to sleep and just get into it in a commercial come on. i forgot to turn off auto play and now i can make the perfect tolmalis Españoles aquí? Yang pilih Allah like yang pilih Dajjal abaikan. The commercials make it hard to listen when you are going to sleep and wanting to listen to it Wow. 0:33x. Very nice…. I'm worried because of comments 😓 Superb. MY SЕХ LOVE. Superb. A la verga. How did i end up here? I was sleeping to asmr and got woken up by some random spanish words, then i look at the phone and here i am I think it works. I woke up with a phrase on my mind. I typed it out phonetically in a translator and it made sense ( I just spelled it wrong). Is there a way to download this? Would be great to use over my earfones without burning data The only thing i know from the start is
Buenos dias
Buenos tardes
Buenos noche
Buuena mano
Lamesa
Azul and other stuff LOL This shit really works...all you have to do is hit play, then fall asleep, say your prayers before that though. When you wake up you’ll know how to say “Hola”...everything else you ain’t going to remember...but this shit works! “Hola” Why does this video have ads? I’m asleep!! can this make me forget english please explain? OMG...  Horrendous Spanish accent... Annoying vocal tone and volume... The voice should be more subtle, soothing, and mellow for subliminal learning... How could anyone possibly fall asleep to this annoyance or want to emulate it?   This must be a joke. It would be awesome if you could do Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Farsi, Italian, German, French, Yugoslavian,   different versions of Puerto Rician, Cuban, Mexican, Spain, etc. Thank you. You are awesome! Thank you. There are several components to learning Spanish easily . A place I discovered which succeeds in merging these is the Fergs Spanish Blueprint (google it if you're interested) without a doubt the most helpful remedy i've heard of. Check out the great info . Fine for review But can't learn without context. You are going to hear theses words and magically know their meanings? The fact that there’s ads during this while you’re supposed to listen to this while you sleep is ridiculous.  There’s a lot of other videos without all the ads. Wait does this actually work lol these comments give me trust issues Thank you for sharing! Abi sakata gelmeyelim ya bildiklerimizi de unutursak How long duration of the advertise would give you income? I will try to skip more of the minimal duration 😘😘 I'm sorry that I just can do it 🙏🏻🙈☹️ Bueno metodo! Pero la musica me molesto mucho. Prefiero escuchar las frases sin musica. So Spanish speakers only need 3 hours of sleep? Muy interesante. https://youtu.be/G7nRYbplKeA The pronunciation is weird, lol 😍😍😍 This is all seems like a load of nonsense really. You can’t learn while sleeping How could any one listen to that voice, She sounds like an angry vulture. Muchas Gracia's Turn off ads please Please someone tell did it work she said, "Don't they esta..." My homie taught me this....."Necessito ir al bano para kagar".  LOL Free live Spanish online group on zoom platform.if you want to practice or learn Spanish language join today. 
Feel free to contact us for any queries 😊✌-8380846335 The Spanish pronunciation sounds a little robotic Bruh so before was watching this a Spanish ad came on I thought it was nothing but no like four more came on guys I think it’s working 😻😻😻😻 Good video Hola soy quiero ser el único o por lo menos unos de los pocos comentarios en español ah sí alguien me enseña inglés o francés con gusto les enseño todo el español que sé, hasta el idioma de barrio incluyendo el albur..! Les saluda un amigo mexicano..!! I wish the voice they took was more soothing as it is for sleep learning. My nicotine cravings have gone and I no longer pick my nose! Thank you! 😛 This REALLY works! I speak fluent spanish now...just only when I am sleeping. Kinda difficult to go to sleep to this if a commercial cuts in after about 5 minutes into the video 😳🙄 I don't know if this works or not but one thing I do know is that having the same image on screen for hours and hours will in the end damage your screen. I often use sleep learning in my math class This Beat is Dynamite 🙏 hola, estoy atascado hablando español, creo que tengo que aprender inglés de nuevo, por favor envíe ayuda. Can't...!
 Listen...!
Her voice is too loud and annoys the phuk out me so much that I can't sleep!
And why does she have to repeat everything 3X in Spanish, after saying it once in English????
If it worked,she'd only have to speak it once in Spanish! Let it sink in for crying out loud!!! I feel like I'm getting stoned by Rosetta herself! The voice should be softer it’s to loud and scares me. If I turn you down then I can’t hear the relaxing music in the background does it work guys? My covid-19 speaks espanol now Too bad I sleep more than 3 hours I tried it out but after the 4th add I figured I would rather not be brainwashed into buying stuff... This is stupid for the beginners because there is no in written. It should be with both Spanish and English letter with it. Did this actually work for anyone??? All I’m seeing are jokes in the comments! Amazing the amount of idiots who comment insignificant bullshit to ruin someone's video. I appreciate the free video and am very hopeful it helps... thank you Who else wants to try this but can't fall asleep thinking that when you wake up you only speak Spanish 😂 Had 4 Margaritas and woke up at the Alamo? Realizing coming to comments to find serious useful feedback on if it’s good and if I should give it a shot but only find stupid immature jokes and comments that are useless. Love this society. There are  a few tips for how to learn Spanish
Decide precisely why you want to learn Spanish
Try to use Spanish in your everyday life

Thank you 😊 I'm here cause I'm kinda desperate as my exam is in 5 days 😨 my spanish speaking exam is tomorrow, I BETTER WAKE UP READY I just turned on my computer and discovered that I listened to half of this while sleeping last night.  So apparently my computer realized that I was sleeping and decided to teach me Spanish, which is great.  Thank you, computer.  Let's take care of the other half tonight. I did this every night for 7 years, and I now know how to ask for directions to the nearest toilet -

Good lesson.💠 i am doing spanish becuase my family is from clumbia and  i form usa thank you Gracias sinyor Es fantastico! Muchas gracias Paul. Feel like can finally learn Spanish. Si es posible para mi Muchas gracias por la lecciones.

Paul, tengo que que tu cursos pequeños estás muy incredible. This is the very method that babies use to translate till they no longer need their native language to understand. My advice to anyone taking such lessons is to go extremely slow. I wish I had the understanding of the effectiveness therein a few years ago.

It is important to note that for optimal effectiveness and fluency, one needs to be capable of being bilingual. This means that you ought to say the English translation in your mind while saying the Spanish translation aloud. The very concept applies to reading another language. The more you do this you'll realize that you're mentally replacing your native language with the foreign language, yielding fluency in a very natural way. Tell me how effective this is for you when you try it. You're a great teacher! ❤️ I'm from Philippines so it's easy to switch accents😊😊😊 I'm a new subscriber Very impressive! Congratulations- your free Spanish course hits the INSTANT SUCCESS button. Es Fantastico! Gracias Paul. I did very well on this course.  I am getting it! I have been  studying  everyday.

My goal is to speak fluently  by next year.

Each lesson I'm retaining more.

My other goal is to say in spanish what I can say in english.
I know that each lesson is designed to help build a solid vocabulary and conversational skills.

So, I'm going to set a goal to master your mini courses and then tackle your full courses as I progress.

I want to acquire the Spanish,  rather learning it. ( Some things I  just have to learn before acquiring it.)

The same way with english.
I get help from my Spanish speaking friends as well.

I practice speaking with them.

It is also helping. Thank you for this! Me gusta estudiar Espanol para ser hablar mejor. Muy gracias para el lección! (I hope I typed this correctly lol) Thank you. I learned so much it 2 days. I have more to learn and you gave me enthusiasm. It's not as hard as I thought with the help of my God and you. You help me to uninstall the games that I was playing on my phone and dwell on your teaching that will bring grow and strength to my thought process. thank you so much 👍 I love your teaching method. You’re a brilliant teacher! Gracias! I don’t normally leave comments on videos but this the best Spanish teaching video I’ve watched. It was so easy to follow and understand. Thank you This is insanely good.  Like why is this not a thing across all languages. Insanely fantastic teaching right here I love you♥️ You r the best🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Gracias por esto video.

suddenly Ad pops up: Grammerly. You are the best!! You deserve $$$$$$$$$&&. She look like Selena Gomez she’s Mexican too. Why is the V pronounced almost like a B? Then what's the point of having two separate letters if they are both pronounced like B? Yo no sabes por qué vine aquí, ya puedo hablar español bien LOL Great lesson. You should make everyone comment in Spanish language only here. I would like to see them teach a little slower too fast and I get lost I am trying to learn some spanish because where I am from nobody bothers to learn so the Hispanic workers never can understand us talking. So I've decided to learn a little to communicate with them since nobody else will bother to do so. How is "que estas haciendo" what are you doing? I thought "hacienda" was a house, dwelling, so should this translate into "how are you living?" We have the same name :))) Gracias. Really nice job. Only no heart people can dislike this video I’m Spanish and I don’t know how to speak Spanish 😭😭 I love you mam It's coming. Great Teacher ,, Thank you for Taking The Time To Make This lesson Video.

Mirando como enseñas español, mientras estaba estudiando inglés jaja😄 Cool video Good day ma'm!.very good!i like your way you teach.besides you're humble,so very clear..farther,you're beautiful woman!!

Nunca la flojera me llevo a tanto 🤣🤣 Raza neta no se porque veo esto si yo sé español jaja en ves de aprender inglés jaja estoy viendo esto jajajjj Do we really need to use this ¿*Word*? While asking ? I got hella ads in the beginning Now I'm Alejandro Does this help? There are ads now🥺 I slept last night hearing this. I dreamt I was in heaven and an angel 😇 teaching me this so that I can communicate to God as God only speaks Spanish and after I learnt I was taken to meet God and when God came close to me I was amazed God was no one else but Lionel Messi. And as I great fan of Messi I shouted hugged him and then suddenly I wake up. It was a beautiful dream right mate I have a Spanish test tomorrow wish me look, guys


Edit: I fucked it up and got 45%, that's two papers added together 🤣 Gracias Who's also here to see in the comments if it works? 👁️👄👁️ I woke up making tacos-








Recommend 100% Video is great,.but YouTube stops it for ads... I think it's immoral to disturb peaceful vids like this one meant for relaxation time with ads. This would be okay if you're trying to learn a few phrases while doing something that doesn't require full concentration, but because of the numerous ads and the fact that you miss a lot of on-screen tips for gender and formality, I wouldn't recommend this for sleeping. So did it work? “Much as Gracias”

Ad: HOLA AMIGO

“/ Yall I'm gonna film a video and post how it went if u want to see it like this comment so I can give u the link lol soy de colombia wey y viendo esto me hace pensar que los que hablan español somos importantes jajajaja que pedo good bye Spainish language is a easy.😁😀🇪🇸👍 I love my spainish languase.😁😀🇪🇸 can someone just say did it work or not? im tired of reading jokes in the comments lol I will try anyways good night yall Woke up speaking Spanish so I guess it worked.

Can't we just use ser and invalidate estar? HAHAHAHAH will spaniards understand? Are Tú Eres and Eres mean the same? is paris capital of france ? what will we  use ES or Esta ? Put more simply:
Ser    = what you are all the time. 
Estar = how or where you are at one particular moment. I learned more from 3 videos of him than from two years spanish on school. Just thanks for doing this. sir, you put tilde again on the letter O of sois.it is just sois, without a tilde. Permanent condition vs temporary state. Great!  But what if I am feeling lazy this morning (temporary) vs. I am a lazy person (condition)? Can we say, “Estoy perezoso” for I am lazy (now), and “Soy perezoso” if I am a lazy person (by nature, all the time) ? This really help me a lot, Thank you so much! Best teacher! I love your lessons they're helpful thank you 9:50 The charts are amazing.
It's my first time to try to learn Spanish on my own and it's very simple because of you. 
Thank you very much Too good 👍 nice Can someone please explain when to use “conocer” versus “saber”? Thank you so much for such a simplified video...you teach really very well...i have started learning spanish recently and I am very lucky to find your channel at the earliest without wasting much time elsewhere ..really grateful to you. Wow. You are a great teacher 
Thank you. You just made my life 10Xs easier!! I was so confused as to when to use the two forms of to be.. Thank you so much!! Gracias maestro 😊😊 I’m so glad that I found this video! 
Thank you very much! You’re goated Among all the teachers ur the coolest and easiest to teach🌺 This guy is really good...His explanations make life easy for students He's an appealing Spanish teacher. Because of him, I'm learning Spanish The last minute told me everything I need to know. Thank you! 🙌🏽 Thank you so much from Thailand ✨ Mucho gracias Thank you so much for this, so helpful!! Tu eres excellente! What if you don't know if it's permative? Like if you see blind person. How are you supposed to know if it's permative condition or not? thankyou sir Love from india u are teaching great Me gusta arboles. Ellas estan triste! So howto say: I'm at the mall? Im glad this guy was born 😌 You really teach so clear as the waters..everything you say is comprehensibly great...I can understand quickly by the way how you explain each word..thank you so much... Very sorry, but you don't have idea about the verb ser and estar :(. You tell about when use the verb ser or estar, but you don't tell what is the diference between ser and estar. Why not?. Very easy, because you don't know nothing about the verb ser and estar. So do you say nosotros  estamos? Why? Such a great teacher!! The way he goes through everything is fantastic. However... I hate the alarm clock intro and outro 😹🤯 Eres un muy buen profesor de espanol Gracias This is great! Pretty well explained it. As a native Spanish I was trying to help my wife with the difference of "ser y estar" and I had no idea how to start, it was very helpful... for both of us 😅 best teacher hands down I want to watch your videos but it's very hard to find each episode serially Thank you so much I am in third grade and need help with ser y estar what grade do you teach if you don’t teach you should teach Spanish hundred percent abocado sounds like avocado 🥑
😂 I think he is the best Spanish teacher on the internet. He doesn't dither or go off on an unrelated tangent. He not only sticks vehemently to what is being taught but also makes it memorable by using simple easy to understand memory tools like charts and phonics. Extremadamente impresionante! ser o no ser What if a child is small? Especially in the very young age where their height grows fast? Would we use ser or estar there?

Or when we want to say "This building is huge" while standing there in order to completely destroy it within the next seconds, so it won't be huge anymore very soon? Thanks! There is NOT an accent on the word "sois".  Any way you can somehow fix that in the video? THANK YOU!! 😀👏🏽
you really make this so much easier to understand. A brilliant teacher... a big thank you for sharing your knowledge.. Wish all teachers were like him then the students would have no difficulty learning and understanding any subject. 4:15 he says the building is tall it doesn't change what about demolition This is a great video. However, there is no accent mark on 'sois'. Wow, this is a great video, I understood everything. I've been learning spanish since a while ago, and between this videos and the app LangLandia, I can say that I'm becoming fluent. 🌷🤗 I am even ready to pay tuition for his classes. What an amazing professor! Gracias! MUCHAS GRACIAS I understood the 2 verbs well now. thanks a lot sir. Muchas gracias. i dont like this video I spent 12000 rupees ( India) for level 1 to learn spanish and they did not even give a proper explanation of the questions i asked. after seeing your video, i feel i should have just found your video before. amazing teaching and patiently explaining each and every concept of spanish. thank you so much! muchas gracias. You're such a great teacher, the problem is I just need someone to practice with You are a blessing sir.   I only follow your classes.  I am done with the 9th video and came.back to this one to revise.  I have never seen such a  wonderful language teacher on U tube.  It's true that in Information Age, everything is available online BuT, we also have to find the best one that there is.   And I am blessed and glad to have found your channel, sir. Im from the Philippines and still quarantine sk is started learning español. 

Btw can we have a quiz? Sois, vais y dais son monosílabos que no se acentúan. I find this content so informative and helpful so I'm subscribed now. Whats popin If I'm depressed, should i say (Yo soy Deprimido) or (Yo estoy Deprimido)? For me,  a fascinating exception to the rule is the state of being dead, Most people, I´m sure, think of it as a permanent condition.  HOWEVER, in Spanish we use "estar"!  Napoleon is dead =  Napoleon está muerto. im 11-12 and i wanna learn spanish so much , this helped me so much , thanks My native language is Spanish and using ser or estar is easy :/ If Yo Estoy and Estoy both means "I am". 
then does both Tu estas and estas mean "you are"? ¡Muchísimas gracias, maestro! All I can say is THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!! You made this SO easy!! I am so glad to have found this channel. Finally, someone has explained the syntax, grammar, pronouns, verbs in Spanish. This is something I am confused now I know and continue to learn. Thank you so much. woke up at 2am today with sudden great interest to learn spanish...and found ur chanel sir, its really amazing and interesting..Muchas Gracias....
(got a new subscriber)
may u stay safe and happy sir,  may god bless u) If you wanna practice your Spanish, send me a DM on instagram (ayrton.sanna). I'm from Argentina and i wanna practice my English too. Wait which one would you use if you’re saying ‘I’m kind’ I am enjoying this lecture very well, i will do my best to master Spanish . Very good I love that !!!Thank you so much !!You have such a talent !!❤️❤️ Thanks a lot!!! You have a new subscriber! My college professor is making Spanish so challenging. But those last two sentences were the best thing to hear. It literally dawned on me I have been trying to learn all these phrases and words and what conjunctions go with what but after hearing that I want to commend you. I always get nervous with what goes with what. Thanks so much! People that speak Portuguese: 👁👄👁 Sufran como nosotros sufrimos al aprender el inglés. Thank you for this but does this change through the tenses too? This message will probably never be seen You know, this is the hardest verb for me to get my head around but that final bit of advice told to you by your teacher was the icing on the cake for me. Thanks. Perfecto Gracias !! This was very helpful Great 👍 teacher 👍👍👍🙏 Great teacher 👍🏾 Awesome! Thank you for making it simple for us. Can someone explain to me why is it Ella estar escribiendo but not Ella estar escribe This why public schools are obsolete ^. One man can teach a million, and thousands can collaborate and learn together. Public schools should've been closed back in 2010, and converted to apprentice shop classes for occupations that require (hands-on) work. Quick question:
At 12:13 , you say "Ella Esta triste"
Based on the previous lesson, wouldn't that be Ella Esta Trista? Or is it the same?
dont hate this is my first day learning spanish Great explanation! Thank you! Why would anybody dislike that video ?? Very helpful thank you 🙏🏻 I’ve been learning spainish on and off for 3 years and I wish I had this lesson a lot earlier on. Countdown 400 days till I visit my family in Chile. So I will definitely be watching your videos over and over till I get the foundation down along with many other things. Thank you for helping me slowly, but surely become fluent and hopefully use more and more on daily basis!What’s your name?

I have a creepy spanish friend.- hola ...🤣 Con el ruido del eclipse
la noche quitó su enagua,
la luna del gran silencio
nuestra azotea palpaba
y mientras cubría tu rostro
el lucero de su andanada
yo te tenía en mis brazos
en el balcón de la playa.

Sobre la arena embestían
los toros bravos del agua
y traernos el océano
sus doce olas de plata
por la pampa de mi pecho
tu mejilla quedó varada.

En el mundo de los sueños
tus dos ojitos nadaban,
la brisa cruzó la costa
como una lengua salada
y el frescor de sus caricias
ponía en tus dos pestañas
la veleta de los trigos
y una sonrisa en mi cara.

¡Que alegría!, ¡que dulzura!
emanaba su joven alma,
mi hijo pequeño dormía
y algo bonito soñaba,
que por eso en mis dos ojos
la ternura vino a la fragua,
que tres meses tienen sus muecas
que sus labios son escarlata
y por su piel de alabastro
mi corazón se derrama.

Yo seguía tarareando
de mi garganta una nana
destrenzando pensamientos
en poesías trenzadas
del amor que llevo dentro
versado en notas doradas
cuando una fugaz estrella
con el polvo de sus alas
vino tras mi sonsonete
al ver como te besaba.

Yo dejé de cantar entonces
todavía lejos del alba
y al morir todas las luces
de neón desordenadas
prendió en toda su grandeza
el fulgor de la vía láctea.

El abrazo de la concha
en mis oídos silbaba,
la luna hecha de papiro
sobre ti se desgranaba
y en ese mismo momento
enmudecieron las arpas
de todos mis pensamientos
abriendo paso a las hadas
de ese paisaje de amor
que inconsciente regalabas,
sumiéndome por completo
en la atmósfera de la playa,
sumergiendo mi universo
en los sueños de tu mirada,
sintiendo el placer de amarte
rodeado de la dulce nada. :V es chistoso ver esto hablando español🤣😂 Confirmen si vinieron para ver como aprenden español los gringos mientras uno siempre se tira en la materia de ingles✨👁️👄👁️✨

Anyway, if you don't want to, don't worry, thanks for your attention Hi! Someone to make a exchange of languages?  
If you help me with english I can help you with spanish. :) No one:

Me being filipino: GWAPO?!
(It also means handsome) Gracias i'm learning Spanish cuz my bf is Spanish  lol COOL Maybe go a bit faster?? Soy de egipto  muchas gracias para este vídeo❤️❤️❤️The very first lesson slide (Hola) has an error. Please, everyone, go elsewhere for your Spanish lessons. First word taught: “Hola”. It’s grammatically wrong!! It does not have an accent and they’ve placed one on the letter “o”.  
Second teaching slide: “Buenos días”. It’s not supposed to have an accent on the letter “a”, but on the letter “i”. 
These are basic fundamental parts of the language! It is not to be used at will. Gracias:) noob This is so wrong "hóla" is wrongly written, it has no accent (´), it´d be "Hola" Hola Todo el mundo! co'mo estas'? Que hago aca si se hablar perfectamente español? Thanks for sharing the useful tips with us.

#TranslationCompaniesInIndia -  http://www.translationworkzone.com/ Great for total beginner. so helpful thanks😊😊 this was worthless! What the hell is this!!!! Since when we write hóla, diás... it should be hola and días. Buenos tardes!!! Tardes is feminine so buenos needs to be too, and it should say buenas tardes. This only in the first 50 seconds of the most basic lesson. Absolutely rubbish. Wow! Hard to believe that there is a fundamental grammar error (discordance of gender) 53 seconds into this first lesson.  The word ""tarde" is feminine so the correct way to say "Good afternoon" is "buenas tardes", NOT "buenos".  This is not just a typo because the speaker also days BuenOs tardes. OMG I said nochos There are several components to teaching yourself to understand Spanish  . A plan I discovered that successfully combines these is the Fergs Spanish Blueprint (look for it on google) without a doubt the no.1 treatment i've seen. Check out all the great information . Hey man. Thank you for this. Hola:  how does one download the mp3 versions of all 40 lessons?  Repetitive listening is crucial to my comprehension.  BTW:  thanks for your graciousness. This is very very incorrect. ZZZzzzzzzz what huh ............ the video's over?......... how long was I out.............WHAT YEAR IS IT!!! Hellow if someone read this. i am form Spain, this video isn´t so good. In the video all is Google traductor, and a lot of the things are not write. How do you download the 40 lessons? I’m thinking about learning Spanish. My husband is from Spain and i want to be able to speak with his family members and of course i NEED to understand what he is talking with friends :) I bought myself a book few years ago, but i’m too lazy to read it and i have no time for that because i have a job and a kid. So i decided that i need a good audiobook to listen in the car while driving to my job. Any recommendations? This is really bad. If you want to learn Spanish. Turn away immediately. Where did the web site go??  Looks like your link is no good anymore... you give up?? Hasta luogo

 I want learn Spanish .
Skype : nazmulsp21 Buenos tardes ¿? O Buenas tardes -.- Hola, I am Vietnamese ^^ Wow thank you I'm writing this down and studying it so my friend and I can speak Spanish in school and pretty much no one will know what we are saying :D Thank you amigo “Hola” does not need a written   accent because  the stress is  heard in the voice.  “Hola” is what we call “grave” because it ends with a vowel.  Therefore, 
  the stress automatically falls on the penultimate syllable  (next to the last syllable). .. Are you familiar the various word types:  AGUDA, GRAVE, ESDRÚJULA, SOBRE-ESDRÚJULA . You can do some research and know how to apply accents correctly. Please place your accent over  the weak vowel:  Bue-nos dí-as (not over  the “a.”)  Otherwise the stress will be placed on the wrong syllable—A dipthong becomes separated into  two syllables when the weak vowel is accented like in An-zal-dú-a , Ma-rí-a, Ra-úl, and a –le-grí-a).
As a retired high school and college Spanish instructor  for over 20 years, I can spot these errors very easily.  Hope you don’t mind these corrections.  Correction:  Instead of "Buenos tardes" you should have said "Buenas tardes."  "Tardes" is feminine noun which requires a feminine adjective. .  Please change your program. its not Hóla, its hola. Its not Buenos diás, its Buenos días. I like it! Slow so people can understand it! It is similar to the videos from Speak Spanish Now! Worth taking a look. De las tres primeras palabras, dos mal escritas. Es "hola" y "días". You can't write Spanish and yet you think you can teach it. Review your spelling. Your lessons are full of spelling mistakes.

 Buenos dias. Buenas Tardes. Buenas noches. In Mexico, where I've lived and worked for 27 years, that's how they say it. Maybe it's different in the US Spanish speakers say it different - slang maybe?  
 Actually it is "Buenas Tardes" instead of "Buenos"
Also, if you're gonna put an accent on "Buenos Dias" make sure it's on the "i" and not on the "a" as it shows in the video. It's a good video, but these mistakes can confuse people.  it's Buenos Tardes not Buenas Tardes vv -.- the tutorial is right! They're wrong within the first couple of minutes! It's not BUENOS tardes, it's BUENAS tardes!!  Sure dude, mail me and start our class I would be more than happy to help you in English. I am fluent in English, Filipino, and Hindi. I would really love it if you could help me learn Spanish. :) Hola,   but not  Hóla c: "Hasta la vista" and not "asta la vista." It has an "h" at the beginning. "Yes! Dude, I downloaded it, and now when I want to extract it, it asks me a password. Do u know what should I do?  Muy buen trabajo. Sólo añadiría algunos pequeños despites por si los quisieras corregir:

Hola no lleva acento.
Días lleva acento en la "i".
Good afternoon se traduce como "Buenas" tardes, no "Buenos" tardes, ya que "tarde" se considera femenino. Por ejemplo "Esta tarde lloverá mucho".

Por lo demás, todo estupendo. Dude Thanks!!!! U made my fucking day! >>> H T T P :   /   /  E::::::A:::::S:::::Y:::::D.::::L.....ORG<<<<

Use to drive me crazy - still used it for a year because parents said they "spent their hard earned money for it". This vid sucks, it doesn't teach you anything!

Pero yo quisiera aprender ingles 
Hagan un video Porfavor 
Gracias Best Spanish courses I found! Gracias 🙏 im mexican and i fully understand this but im losing my words but i know the basics but ill watch this every night How can ı find good partner for practice en Spanish The conversation should be repeated, it is to much to learn at one time. I wonder when will I be able to have conversation with someone in Spanish. So excited This is great!! 😁❤️ Yo tengo una pregunta para usted: Do you have suggestions for how I can train my brain to recognize Spanish when it’s spoken to me? I’m a visual learner so learning from books is easy for me, but the “audio only” component is taking longer for me to grasp. I hate Spanish it sucks I was under the impression the hot chick from the thumb nail would be teaching 🤦‍♂️ I don't know why I'm here if I am latina,if you want learn de común Spanish I can help you xd This conversation gave me brain cancer El latín fue la lengua de la antigua Roma y en la Edad Media tuvo su mayor difusión y prestigio cultural. El engrandecimiento de Roma hizo posible esta difusión. Hoy día, la lengua neolatina más sonora es el italiano, por la abundancia de vocales. Sin embargo, este idioma continúa empleando la doble z, la doble t, etc. El francés por su parte utiliza mucho la pronunciación con acento agudo y palabras multiacentuadas. Contrariamente el inglés omite este acento ortográfico. El español es, por tanto, el más evolucionado y ponderado de las lenguas actuales. Su gramática es bastante completa y fonéticamente goza de gran sonoridad y claridad. Tiene uniformidad de timbre y sus muchas palabras permiten la libre construcción. Una vocal española permanece igual mientras dura su pronunciación. No se producen, por tanto, vocales apagadas o de timbre indeciso, tan peculiares del inglés. EL ESPAÑOL ES NUESTRO MAYOR MONUMENTO CULTURAL. Yeah very nice your language. Hi, my name is Yorjanis, I'm from Colombia and I'm interested in practicing English. I have a very basic level. I can teach you Spanish. my email is yorjanis030586@hotmail.com Is this mexican Spanish?? Or Spain Spanish?? My advice is to learn the Mexican version of Spanish. Last name is montes so I was like huh? Speech therapy Spanish English translatied Speak please Noah Fulmor Salah I would love to learn Spanish!

This is great! Except it’s so the opposite nobody speaks Spanish in the south and Chicago has lots of native speakers 😂 the south is “yall” territory I love Spanish X2 speed learn Spanish in 30 minutes Does this video cater to the spanish that's spoken in Spain or Mexico? If talking to a female should it not be encantada, and encantando when talking to a man?  The video is the other way round? hi, i have a podcast  called "Pastillitas de Español", and so many episodes to practice spanish talks. you can find me on spotify, google podcast, apple podcast,etc Imbtrying to learn spanish for my mariachi, pop music. For interviews, talking with fans. I wish I would’ve taken learning Spanish more seriously in High School importantissimo I already know 2 languages but I’m going for my third maybe even 4th One thing I know I'm gonna struggle with is context.
"What does that mean?" and "What's that supposed to mean?" would by definition have the same meaning, but one is just a question and one is feeling insulted Hi guys Can you tell me what different between mexco spanish and erope spanish? I didnt like it. I loved it Hi, my name is Javier from Colombia, I wanna know people to speak English so that make a interchage between Spanish to English. My whatapp is 3135440254. I like the way you read the sentence very slowly, which is very useful for beginners and foreign language learners. Thank you.

I remember when I first wanted to learn spanish.
I was on a trip to Puerto Rico and it was amazing but I had a difficult time communicating with the locals. 
I thought it'd be really helpful to learn the basics so my trip could be much smoother. It's amazing because after I took this course I went to Mexico and the natives were so impressed with how well I spoke!   
Here's the course that really helped me as a beginner. I can now (with confidence) speak spanish fluently!

Mi lengua madre es el español no se que hago aquí 😅 it's intersting take a class of spanish 😅 Always remember to repent of your sins (sin is transgression of YAHUAH’S LAW: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, & Deuteronomy) And Have Belief On YAHUSHA HAMASHYACH. HE Died and Rose three days later so that you can be forgiven of your sins! 

HE Loves you! Come to HIM!🙂🙂🙂🙂 Good video! Puedo no espera por me habla spagnol. I want to say I  can't wait to speak Spanish. Did I say it good? Love it This course is the best course of all time. I’ve tried dozens of methods to try to learn language from podcasts, Yabla, watching TV in other languages, movies, audiobooks but this is the best. I’m gonna pay for the course. Thanks you guys 잘보고있어요 감사합니다 I get mixed up when using al, la, lo, a,  una, un. I get the gender difference but is there a certain rule between al and a. 🦿 I took 3 years of Spanish way back in high school 26 years ago and remember a lot of it, but want to try to work on my fluency now. Thanks but I got a question how they talking to each other from Chicago and Lima and if there talking from device this guys friend must have hit him up to get a girl. Alguno desea practicar su habla en español?, soy Peruano y hablo español ;D. Yo deseo practicar mi inglés. Sería como una ganancia de ambas partes  prácticas tu español y yo practico mi inglés. i’m gonna watch this every night i am really excited to learn spanish Very good Spanish in this video. You can tell they spend time teaching. I learn very well with these lessons because I can see them several times. This combined with my games on LangLandia using my phone, has helped me improve my Spanish! this is good Great! It's a big invention. I admire people, that has such good ideas and do their work, so that it's easy for us to learn/practice. Thank you! hey this really helped me a lot,que tengas un gran día ahora haré esto todos los días muchas gracias siempre quise hablar español con mi familia para que no me entiendan jajaja adios What the difference between encantada and encantadoIs pader also wall in Spanish or not? Wow . Easy lesson to understand such a good teacher 2:15 Yes I am weird because I thought he was going to write down "mesa" and he actually did! 46, trying to learn Spanish for the first time. Really appreciate these videos being free to the public. Great lessons and teacher!! Thank you for the lessons.  It should be Las Paredes at 8:46. What is the difference between alagunos and unos is my new problem :( Best Spanish teacher. He needs more exposure so that lots of people can get benefitted by his Spanish knowledge. I'm learning a lot from u. I'm a Filipino and also a beginner studying spanish. This channel is really great. Profesor, mucha gracias! 🅿️ Awesome!  Thanks for the lesson. Guys do you think these series are enough for A1 in Spanish? Now I know why we (Bisaya) called the table lamesa because in Spanish it is LA MESA. Oooooh Salamat sir💙 thankyou sir I love this guy most out of all of the people I subscribe to to learn Spanish but Spanish with Paul is a close 2nd behind him👀 I did not take Spanish in high school but I now speak better Spanish than my former class mates after about four months. I love and respect this guy 👑 I think you are the best Spanish teacher. Thank u teacher 💙 spanish 1 kids: el dentista (look it up lol) Very interesting wanting to learn more☺️ I need someone with whom I can speak Spanish Finally I understand 
Los Pollos Hermanos Much respect to you... thanks a ton for clearing my doubts Me subscribo. Lo mejor es que soy de Catalunya. Es demasiado entretenido aprender mi idioma He has his own channel The language tutor I bet he got better at grammar when learning Spanish🤣 Ive learned quite a lot of Spanish here
Yo soy aprendo español
Did i say it right? As a lifelong fan of Spanish football, this video was very entertaining. Now I understand the grammar behind words like La Liga, Los Blancos, La Roja, El Clasico, Las Palmas, El Buitre etc. 

Muchísimas gracias! The word wall feels like el pared I’m following lessons simultaneously with Duolingo and your lessons help me a lot. Gracias. This guy is solid. Every lesson is easily graspable. Love your videos, have learnt so much from them. Can you to tell me if you cover me gusta/gustan in any of your videos please. This guy is a sensational teacher! Very impressive! Verb conundrum sorted. 100 thanks! Libro and mesa just the same as cebuano and in tagalog... book and table. some words in Spanish are similar to Filipino words like lamesa and libro both have the same meaning. However, there's just similar word here in Spanish that has different meaning like for example la bandera, in spanish is "the flag" and in Filipino, that is being wrote as one word which would be "labandera" means laundry washer. Just sharing.. whos watching this in 2021 Listening 17/03/2021♥️ Best teacher How do you understand which words are masculine or feminine when they don't end with an "A" or "O"? Omg I’m puertorican americanized. 3rd generation and was never spoken to in spanish with my parents I’m learning this now and practicing w spanish speaking 1st generation coworkers!!! Huge help thank you so much Wow Spanish and Filipino are quite similar. Its crazy how good of a teacher he is 🥇📈 Irregular verbs came about because we are a conflicted species. Understanding the Spanish language will become a critical skill for future employment.

I have been taking spanish courses on and off for years and you make it so simple! Muchas gracias! You better have an S on your chest! 😂 Excellent teacher! I’m learning a lot! Thank you! 🙏🏽 Very nice and patient teacher I already know los angeles  and las vegas  before lesson   XD I had really bad experiences in Spanish class in high school, my teacher was very short tempered so he always ended up shouting at me or my class and it was so scary and upsetting me so much to the point where I dropped the class. I really enjoyed Spanish but he just made it such a negative experience but now learning with you it kind of rewrites those awful memories and makes it such a pleasant experience. Thank you for being such a great teacher, I’ve learned more over the past few days with you than I have in the last 3 years with my old teacher please like, comment, subscribe to thank the guys behind these videos.

Thanks for all the words. My journey with Spanish has been incredible and right now I am relaxing, learning new words every day with these videos and some apps.

Thx. I reall want to learn spanish i am going to watch thislove your videos mr Danny Evans !  despite the fact that english is not my native language but I find your explanations very easy to undertand  
  My salutations from algeria ! :) At this point, I am learning Spanish voluntarily. Muchas gracias Sir. Dios te bendiga Just like a Roy is a next King of past Kings. wait im confused. the "im going to pay" voy a pagar part, was it supposed to be voy a pago? help. in ar verb chart the first box is 'o'? and the ar should be removed and changed depending on the pronoun used or  idk idc. dont attack me im just confUsed. did i miss an ep? White are you from Your teaching is very amazing and more understanding  ,HERO of teaching, thanks should I say "voy a pago", or is it not needed to change "pagar" anymore? (asking about the last example in the video). You are such a great teacher Similar to “ser”… Fun fact… Pagar in Hindi = pay (i.e salary). Guys do you think these series are enough for A1 in Spanish? I'm frustrated by the  idea of this  four year old toddler\tourist speaking lessons when it's true that I would have to say ' I'm going to truck 475 and changing the right rear wheel'. 

No one at work  would care if I were going to a restaurant let alone believe I could afford to. Some Filipinos still use Spanish words especially Bisaya like jabon, vaso, panaderia, tinidor and more because we are colonized by Spaniard for 333 yrs💙 
that's is why abuelos laugh at me when they hear me practicing Spanish🤣💙 If I will be good at speaking the Spanish language, I will share with my classmate how good my online instructor is - Dr. Danny.

Salute to you sir💙Gracias💙 Effective teacher! Wow!   He is effective teaching me. Enjoy these lessons he explains them very well - muy bien!! If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and pleas Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying to force upon anyone who does not agree) I had a hard time learning Spanish in school so this helps a lot. Especially verbs. Thank you! I love the video but there is no accent on vais. I can't believe that I can make different  sentences in Spanish now.  Muchas Gracias lol Polish galeria (shopping mall) in Spanish lessons from USA the world is really small lol Gracias..Dr. Danny Evans. El    espanol es divertida . Please ignore my mistakes, I just started learning I love this guy he is so helpful like I was trying to learn Spanish on duo lingo but I like was very slowly retaining anything it was hard now that I found him me and my whole family are learning spanish🤩 he is/ she is means "Esta" in day 2.5 and now she is means "Ella va".....why? I don’t understand when to use ( a la - la - el ) Galeria Bałtycka on photo in 7:02 is actually located in Gdańsk, Poland :P As an older learner I have found this enjoyable and very understandable. Mi maestro, Dr. Danny Evans, es muy muy bueno con enseñando mi espanol! GRACIAS!!! 😄 (I hope I got that right Professor lol). Gracias.. from indonesia This is easy and logical lesson. Thank you ! I wish you were my teacher! you have really saved me a lot in school! Nice Mr Dany Thanks for letting me think about what I really paying for when I purchase something in unfortunate country. I never thought about that. Amazing way to learn! You are such a great teacher and what a cool way to teach.... I am literally glued to your lessons! Thank you :-) I'm only 11 and this guy helps so much thanks Dr. danny 😌👌 Gracias ! 🙏 You are the best Spanish teacher. I really like your attitude and concern expressed for other people, May the Mercy and Grace of God be with you and bring you safely to His appointed purpose! Your boi This guy is amazing! Great Spanish classes and so easy to learn from you. Thank you I have two questions. First is why you use "a" after IR? second is why you don't use the subject in the formula "IR + A + Infinitive"? Thank you very much. Thank you for your wonderful clarity. I have decided to learn Spanish quite late in life, and your course is a real pleasure, and so easy to follow. Obviously I've subscribed, and I will stay the course, and I am really enjoying it. Who needs to go to live classes? Well, during the lockdown, this is the next best thing. Muchas gracias! Am so confused when to combine or not to combine He makes it so easy yet it is so hard for me to learn still Dr. Danny Evans has his very own youtube channel. Thank you so much I have learned so much and I understand what am learning Great If a male is going to the book store would you change to liberio? Super & thanks from europ “Vais” is a Spain spanish word, but in the Latin-america spanish, we say: VAN 

Ustedes VAN
(You all go)

And “vosotros” is a spain word so you can say: USTEDES 
That’s in latin-america spanish Thanks for these One of your online student from Korea 🤩🤩🤩
I love your lessons. MUCHO GRACIAS!!!! like, comment, and subscribe to say thanks to the guys behind these videos. great teacher Don't you have to say "Yo voy a pagar"? Can you drop the yo? Love these lessons! Finally Spanish grammar starts to make sense! :) I find your videos the best when it comes to Spanish learning. What mother tongue do you have Spanish or English? Thank you for encouraging people to be aware of the value of items to be purchased, and to pay a fair price. So many tourists believe that half of the fun of shopping is haggling the seller down to a super-low price, instead of paying what is reasonable. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. My teacher gave this lesson entirely in fluent Spanish and under 10 minutes. Needless to say, I felt like she was speaking another language. Excellent teacher Enjoy all your lessons so far. After the first one, I was able to understand a line of lyrics in a song.
Your thoughts on buying in a market and the big picture of them making a living is spot on. Thankyou for not having a lengthy irritating intro 👍 thank you im lurning olot Gracias Maestro 😊 I love charts Grâcias senor Danny 'A' in Spanish means 'to' or 'at'. 
When 'a' and 'el' (which means 'to the') comes together in Spanish, eg. 'Yo voy a el correo' ( I am going to the post office)  you combine it to form 'al',  which becomes 'yo voy al correo'. But you do not combine the feminie of 'el' which is 'la' to 'a'.. So 'ella va a la libreria' (she goes to the book store) stays that way. 1. Meat shop: carnicería
2. Pharmacy: farmàcia
3. Bakery: panaderia
4. Book store: librería
5. Library: biblioteca
6. Post office: correo
7. Art gallery/shopping centre(mall?): galeria
8. Museum: museo
9. Restaurant: restaurante 
10: Coffee shop: cafe
11. Movie theater (cinema?): cine I'm a Tanzanian i got & learnt alot from this guy stay blessed You are the greatest I never seen in my life learning language I can call you the father of Zeus all the heroes I knew 😍 jokes !!! Thanks you for teaching us Thank you for this! You are a great teacher!

Por favor Dr. Evans sounds like Berlin in the Netflix series 'La Casa De Papel' everytime él habla español 😊 Stumbled on your site by accident and thoroughly enjoying it. Thank you teacher. I learn a lot im having trouble with this one. You make it easy for me. earlier I was learning Spanish from some other channel but at a certain level the things got mixed up. Then I subscribed your channel and now I think, I'm actually learning Spanish. The way you teach is the easiest and through this, anyone can learn. We are going to the restaurant

Hope it helps :3 This tips are amazing girl, your spanish is very good. Xoxo Being Mexican watching videos on how to learn Spanish the dialect thing is soooo important
in school we need to talk in castellano but I'm dying because in my freetime I'm like never doing this
I mostly talk to mexican people through the Internet but I watch series from every country
so the accent I talk in changes like every day
one day someone told me I'd sound argentinian and the other day after school someone told me I'd speak castellano
that's so weird but kinda funny PS.
Spanish singers I could recommend to you: JOAN MANUEL SERRAT, NINO BRAVO (from Spain) and they're great as their music are just pure poems and with wonderful meaning.
now as a Colombian (from Cali) and as you may know Cali=capital of the salsa in the world( I hate salsa, I do not like it a bit)but there are few salsa songs from the 70s I like to listen to from time to time and they are:
EL DIA DE SUERTE
NO LE PEGUE A LA NEGRA
BABALU
ALEOLUQUI
PARA QUE APRENDA
QUE LO SEPA QUIEN LO SEPA
LAS CUARENTA
creo que esas son todas las canciones (salsa)que me gustan)
so I leave you here with those tips. I want study Spanish language E I also recommend a really helpful youtuber who talks incredibly well. Her name is Irene Nortes and her videos are about life tips, blogs, stories and personal experiences. She lives in Madrid, Spain, so her accent isn't as difficult as people from the south part of Spain. Hi, one espanish PODCAST for people who wants to know more about feelings, personal growth and relationships between people is "HANLÁNDOLE A LA LUNA", you can find it in Spotify. 😁🌈 .

Their content is really funny and entertaining I'm here learning English on a video about how to learn Spanish my native language but I totally agree with you, speaking skills It's the most important thing at end of the day you need to improve this area because if you want to express your ideas logically when you speak with other people know rules and doing a lot of exercises don't will help enough so the main goal is to communicate with other expressing your ideas in the right way not try to be perfect we all are humans (at this moment) if you have a mistaken it's fine it's a process and enjoy your journey. hi,im from Mexico and i study English, im looking for a friends who speaks English to be able to practice (:

I'm a Spanish native speaker, and I'm learning English. Do you a favor and don't listen trap, rap or reggeaton in Spanish, singers of this genres don't pronounce the words correctly when singing, it is even better to listen to sad music in Spanish, those songs are slow and you will be able to understand what the song is about. Listen to Morat!! thank you THANK YOUUUUUU For anyone trying to learn Spanish, if you have an iOS device, you should try Spanish FlashVo, I learnt so much vocab with it. It's free btw, I'm not spamming or anything haha What show should I watch in Spanish? Gringos: Por fin, he aprendido el Español.
Argentinos: "Che boludo como me queda este lompa", "Te paras te mano pa?", "Te bancas la toma gato?", "Sopermi Wachin", "me voy a ir yendo", "Buenardo", "Nashe", "Mandale Mecha", "Bondi", 
Gringos: ._. hola, me gustó tu video :) I luv ur voice and the way u speak 😘 Creo que el mejor para aprender es un español ¿neutro? sin dialectos. Si alguien va y dice "guagua" el resto de Latam+España no entenderá, si dices "autobús" o "bus", todos entenderán. does anyone have recs of easy fun wattpad stories? why does yt keep recomending me this, I'm a native Spanish speaker lmao I clicked on one of iris roig’s videos and instantly liked her accent is it a Spaniard accent or maybe a Venezuela accent? I guess a lot of people strugle a lot learning Spanish. Specially when you think you're doing great and all of the sudden words like "Sobre" or "Mango" appears and have like 5 different meanings. Then you say "i got this" but there's a difference between "ser" y "estar". You make a progress and then there are words that kinda... have no gender at all like "Agua" or "Naranja y naranjo". AND THEN there's the "Native spanish speakers don't know how to speak spanish" when you hear them say things like "Escúchame para que veas" or "Me voy ir yendo". 
And finally (this is way too specific), as a mexican, there's another thing to deal with: EL ALBUR. If you can dominate El Albur, you can dominate the spanish. This is actually a great, really helpful video, thanks! 💗 i m learning engilsh and this works too Si quieren aprender español de México chido, vean Pokémon, James usa muchas frases características de mexicanos 🥴👍🏾

If u want to learn mexican spanish, watch Pokemon, James says a lot of mexican caracteristic phrases 🥴👍🏾 Thank you so much! Also wanned to mention that these tips work for any language you want to learn (proved by me cause I`m native russian speaker and similar tips helped me to learn English) im a beginner learner & this is a language that alot of my friends/family speak. I literally know little to none of spanish. So im aware that it takes time, but honestly its really hard. Wow.. Great information !! (These are recommendations from a Spanish speaker so please translate)
bueno canciones que les recomiendo para que aprendan mas que todo por que es un lenguaje sencillo y fácil de comprender 
-juanes (todas sus canciones son fáciles de comprender )
-enrique iglesias 
-carlos vives
-chayane
esto va a sonar raro pero busquen asi *música para planchar * 
les recomiendo que eviten el reguetón mientras aun son principiantes ya que usan metáforas y no completan frases y algunos son difíciles de comprender pero obviamente hay cantantes de reguetón  que se les entiende bien pero personalmente no se los recomiendo 
y bueno ya que estamos dando recomendaciones yo estoy tratando de aprender ingles que me recomiendan ¡eres un salvavidas! Hablo español ya de inglés a español now i know spanish which dialect would someone suggest that may be more "universally" understood in most latin american countries and/or spain?

I have been trying to learn German and French for the last 6 months. Believe me, I can teach Spanish for beginners for two months using these seven lessons.

Muchas gracias colega
Dr. H. B.K Dr. Evans really puts himself in the student's shoes so that the lessons are easy to be understood. Thank you so much for your passion for teaching! Pretty easy. Thanks im home schooled and he really helps me with my spanish Tough session but Mr. Evans broke it down into manageable bits as usual. Muchas gracias Gracias Professor ! Thank you for these lessons.

Once again, thanks a lot from the bottom of my heart.
Love from India 👌👌👌 Dr. Evans thanks so much I really love your teaching style. I have learned so much it is very easy to comprehend. Thanks! Hey dr I know this is probably not going to be looked at but I must know how many verbs like decir are "interesting" with the (i) thing? This is where it started getting a bit complicated... 17:32 please explain someone. WHY My grandmother loved this channel on TV, but didn't realize the breadth of the diversity in content it offered. The way he teaches is so easy to understand. I’m gonna copy him 😊 This episode is hard to understand but I guess I need to research more. Thank you Sir!!! Gracias  Don.

Good thing I can just rewatch until I master this. Gracias!! A smart teacher will produce a smart student. Thank you sir 😘 this lesson is better than going to a paid class.kudos and you deserve a heart and a like and additional subscriber. The grammar of Spanish is more difficult than English, the grammar of Chinese is really easy. Although I’m a good learner, my problem is freezing when someone talks back to me in Spanish, I don’t understand a word they are saying.  Lol Such a fantastic teacher -  thank you so much! is it Pooler or poder?, I can't figure it out. Thank you Dr. Evans ❤ Thank you for teaching  Spanish lessons. You making easy to understand. If you are going to a schhol and meet a teacher like Dr. Evans, then you are lucky student.  Everyone can be lucky if you meet him on Youtube. I'm a tanzanian i get to learn more.long lyf monseur evasn😄😄😄😄 He is one of the best teachers in YouTube teaching Spanish.. Spanish  Episode When I am ready to master this language, this is definitely the guy to teach! He's an amazing teacher. Reminds me of my Southern Texas Spanish teacher. Two years and took away nothing...
Watching it now, in this way, is very different. Much better! But still, this Close to the boarder, spanglish, just enough to communicate, will work. Spanish speakers are prolific in it as well as English speakers trying to communicate in Spanish.  It's truly a language all in itself. Spoken and understood....
I took two years of similar Spanish and reality would be just enough to communicate, especially considering Spanish speakers understand, and once you learn the basics, then everything else he says can apply. Real world, just learn the basics of communicating. 
Then, master the language. His language, mastering. Very different then mastering the basics, basics that translate through our borders. I think that I’m gonna give up right here😂 this lesson is hard😭😭 Before its really difficult for me to recognize the singular and plural in spanish but eversince that i watch your video i easily know them.muchas gracias U.. Ue
O.. Ue
E.. Ie Hacer (to do, to give).
Salir (to leave).
Poner (to put) vais y todos esos se utlizan solo en españa no tienen que ver nada con el spañol de america , el español de america y el de españa son diferentes, I am Spanish and it is amazing the way you teach, congratulations! ya allah plz forgive me  stop watching this. I live in Turkey and english is not my national language. But im here after 6 classes. This man really taught me spanish. I write down every single word and then exercise with them now i can speak spanish! Muchas gracias. Thank you so much! Thank you In ＂tengo algo que hacer" What is the 'que' for?Can it be removed ？ Congrats! very well explained, as a native speaker I would have never imagined this could be so complicated for foreign lerners, encouragement! When you use Ver for I see yo veo. Does that only mean literally like I see the sign or can you use i see as in understand. Por ejemplo I see what you mean. I Iove these charts work Paired with Butterfly Spanish, they cover everything! You are so adorable in these videos your teaching is great, thank you. Thanks How about tener? MAGNIFICO!! Great teacher indeed!! Someone please help me out Uggghhhh what's happening 😭 How do you know if its an irregular verb? What if you conjugate an irregular verb the same way as a regular verb? I am Russian learning espanol from english native speaker teacher. Two in one😂😂🙈thank you, Dr.Evans, it's a good lesson. We in Latin America dont like to use the fifth conjugation which is used only in spain Only in Spain they use the fifth verb in latin america we use the sixth verb in place of the fifth conjugation Excellent video really helpful Another words in Cebuano

Puder 👉 under the custody of someone - the ones who are able to provide something.

Umpisa (to begin) a little similar to empezar.


I guess it's fun. 😅😅 I guess we got the Cebuano word "HAGO" from Spanish.

It means "TIRING"

When we are done with a work or something that makes us exhausted, we say "KA HAGO" 😂😂

Hacer it is 😅😅😅 It's really fun to learn spanish since I could unsdertand some of the words.
I am a Cebuano native here in the Philippines and we adapted some spanish words like 

kwaderno 👉 notebook
(not in spanish spelling yet they have the same sound 😂)

Lapis 👉 pencil
(pluma is a Tagalog word)

Pwerta (pertahan/pultahan) 👉 a portal / door

lamesa (cebuano) 👉 a table
mesa (tagalog)

There are a lot of words I know which I guess it easier for me to learn this lengwahe 😂
Kutsara (tablespoon)
kutsarita (teaspoon)
plato (plate)
platito (saucer)
baso (glass)
sapatos (shoes)

I just laugh with the word PARED (wall). In cebuano we call it PADER.
Isn't it amazing? 😂 Ok im done , bye espaniol Yo soy de India. I want to learn Spanish. Nice searched for my Spanish paper Really enjoying your lessons while I go for my walks.

Gracias very well explained and made spanish interesting for me Dr.Danny evans . There were millions of views on his first video of these series then in the next vids views were declining. They're like drop out students.

Yo asisto hasta final! Dr.  Evans, you have taught me more in seven videos than I was able to understand in a few weeks.  Your teaching style is so easy to grasp and very engaging.  I feel so much better about my beginner skills.  Great job, and keep the videos coming!! Is there anyone out their who speak spanish whose willing to help me or have conversation with me because I couldn't find anyone whose friendly most of them are either rude or flirty . I would really appreciate your help . This is great first video I found and I’m hooked gonna watch them all hopefully typing in Spanish maybe by the end 😂Que Hora Es | Season 2: Episode 1 is now on our channel! Click this link: https://youtu.be/stBbNZT-Gro

Don't forget to subscribe and click the notification bell. Thank you for watching the AIB Network! We hope your pursuit of learning the Spanish language is successful. Ganbatte pak you are the best teacher emo Ty you sooooo much sir Easy to remember, hard to speak. :( I took beginners spanish in university and this is by far a much better method of learning You are the best 👨‍🏫 Thank u teacher i will never forget that 😊💙 Guys do you think these series are enough for A1 in Spanish? ❤️❤️❤️ dream comes true...
now yo aprendo español... episode 5 ir is an exceptn or there are any other ir verb in that category? this episode ir verb rule is for all ir verbs?🙏 When you enjoy something , it’s feel like a minute or second to you . 
Mr. Danny’s teaching is one of those things . Learning Spanish by watching the Spanish lesson in English language while my native language is Bahasa Indonesia. Feel like a pro Such a marvellous teacher 🌺.thankyou so much 🙏much love from India 🇮🇳 💐 Getting the workbook helped me a lot - Glad it is available - Thanks :) yo apprendo espa~nol,gracias what is the name of the superb instructor? This teacher deserve a global award. I'd vote for him 1000 times👏👏👏 in epsiode 5, ir means to go and now ir means to live..............what are the difference? i dont know I've learnt so much from you Sir thank you very much! LOVE how YOU teach helps me so much in my class...THANK YOU Thank you for the best lessons! ER verbs:
comer-to eat
leer- to read
creer- to believe or think
correr- to run
aprender- to learn

IR verbs:
vivir- to live
escribir- to write
abrir- to open
recibir- to receive
asistir- to attend/assist gracias sir. we learned a lot from you. Best Spanish lessons ever. Amazingly simple and easy to follow. I've studied Spanish for almost eight years and was always frustrated with the "basics." You teach in a way that the basics are included and explained so that understanding the language, rather than simply mimicking the language, makes learning so much more effective. Thank you so very much for this platform, I've tried learning for years on my own and at evening classes, no teacher has described or put verbs and words quite together as you. I'm enjoying the videos very much you tell it like it is between the lines so clearly, and like your other followers I'm learning so much more. A massive thank you.😇 Much respect to the teacher! Great Job You are the best teacher. Mucho gracias He has his own channel now. "The Language Tutor". ¡Gracias por esto! thank you so much ..it is really amazing I'm thinking I'm so lucky to meet you teaching us these Spainsh lessons and I also really appreciate and admire such kind of not taking any benefits like cash in others. I'm also surprised and glad. You are giving and kind man. I wish you all the best and yeah you will. I think he is the best of all Il learn a lot🤙 creo que el es muy tonte y no me gusta  i wish the teacher wouldn't make us listen to this guy thank u very much...but why you said (nosotros estudiamos ) instead of estamos estudiamos??? One of the verbs that made life difficult for me the most was IR, until I finally took charge of my teaching and started learning online from home. I downloaded the LangLandia app, started watching these videos, and now I live in Latin America where I can talk to everyone! Thank you for making this easier to understand and practice . Most of all , for making it  fun !! Learning very easily with you.
Great content 👌.. 
#6:15 "I'm Learning Spanish"
Wouldn't this be aprendiendo not aprendo.? Bro My dad wants me to know spanish and like when i started learning from you i got so better ur best spanish teacher Tysmmm Yo aprendo español or estoy aprendiendo español..........please explain like, comment, and subscribe to say thanks to the guys behind these videos. Farmacia should not have an accent over the ‘i’ as far as I can remember. Danny,

Just letting you know that I found your stuff on a Roku channel "Learning Spanish", after Sona's stuff but there was no sound in any of the lessons. I tried uninstalling the channel and re-install it but there was still no sound. Just letting you know. It looks like you have some great stuff/reminders for me. (Meaning I got to the conversational level in HS then stopped using the language.) Once you fix this you can delete my comment.

Mike He is the best teacher! You can do it! omigosh thank you so much, my teacher's class has been like entering the depths of hell and your video has ascended me to heaven Hello there, for how long, did you study Spanish to teach that beautiful way you teach? I just started watching your videos and I can easily understand and learn how to hablar español gracias! I'm a Sapnish native speaker and now I aspire to be a Sapnish teacher like this guy. Casi me rindo hasta que me reuní con FREDRICHACK en IG, quien me ayudó a recuperar mi cuenta de Instagram. Muchas gracias a FREDRICHACK 💝 Good teacher!! Quick question.. shouldn't it be "" soy (i am)  aprendo espanol" instead of  'Yo (i)  aprendo"?? I would pay for his classes Where could I go to lean simple spanglish? This is proper Spanish. If someone could take his beginning courses and focus only on basics...just enough to conversate... Spanish speakers could ultimately understand what you're trying to say. The basics... Muchas gracias😊 I'm from Spain,  only two things:

- When you speak Spanish you can just substrack the pronom, for example:
Instead of saying *Nosotros comemos* you can say *Comemos*, because you already now than you mean we by the conjugation.

- In the minute 6:25 you said Ella aprende alemán, it's correct, but if you are talking in present continuous, you have to keep in present continuous, so instead of saying *Ella aprende aleman*, you should say  *Ella está aprendiendo alemán*

But the class is very good, good job. WOOOOW. I have never seen such a great teacher. O imos

All the respect and appreciations. You are a god send, Dr  Evans.  Thanks so much for all that you are doing. He is an excellent teacher!

But I started learning Spanish with this guy in one week and I know so much more in Spanish know you are an great teacher , ı cant learn that good even if ı pay money is episode 7 missing? no wait what was in episode 5 then? there too we were taught IR verbs? then how is the chart different? This is a dumb question. How does Ricky Martin say "liva la vida loca" but the words don't match the meaning of live? This is really amazing lesson with great teacher . Thank you so much for your work! So im confused, why do i need to "purchase" this program if you just have it uploaded for free on your youtube channel? Guys! Please watch all the ads to help this excellent teacher gain some money. He deserves that! Your are an amazing teacher!

Tenía curiosidad por como era un listening en español y que tan estúpido se escucha. Me siento pro al entenderlo todo jsjsjs From the first one I only got "¡está muy caro!" 😁 And "muy bien aquí tiene" Where do you suppose her accent is exactly from? I live in San Diego and I've never heard her accent before. 7:50 Oh this isn’t so bad. 
7:55 IM SORRY?! Muchas Gracias❤❤ SETECIENTOS PESOS I am learning Spanish now, but I can’t catch up with listening to Spanish conversation. SOS El pepe ete sech 700 ufff re barato This woman sound so bored with her job!!! PLease tell me they don't sound like that in Latin America. At the very beginning you can even hear her sigh !!! Yes I am so f***** having a spanish listening test in 8 minutes and I don’t understand shi* :’D jajaja, estaba por poner un ejercicio de listening en ingles, pero me dió curiosidad el de español muchas gracias este video es perfecto Yo aquí viendo como hacen esta wea de listening  jajaja soy yo pero hablan muy formal ya que nadie de nosotros lo hace jajja 🤣🤣🤣 *a esta caro, ya vuelvo* jajaj y jamás vuelve jaja Se siente re seco :v
Parecen los doblajes de los programas gringos 😂 Lie si hablas español como primer idioma, pero entraste por curiosidad asdfghjkl y crees que parecen drogados hablando asdfghjklñ Aquí casual aprendiendo mi propio idioma 
Posd: que pedo con sus voces She is really fast and sweet and did anyone notice the video is perfectly 32:32 Como cuando te crees muy crack por hablar español, pero respondes mal las preguntas 😂 I am native spanish speaker, I am learning english. If anybody wants learn with me spanish I can help him. que hago aqui 0-0 Con listening así, no lograran que aprendan, se escucha muy forzado, y con voz computarizada, sino lo ponen un poco de "sentimiento" tal vez, no lograran una mejor comprensión y será más difícil aprender Así es yo soy el pndj que busco esto para saber como son los lisening o como se escriba en español xd JKASJKASJKASJASKJAS PWRO- que raro es esto JAJAJAJAJAJA Se pasan de babosooos!!! Jajajajaj No es cual collar es que collar, si hacéis esto para que la gente aprenda almenos hacedlo bien hablado Por q parecen drogados.???jajaj Porque hablan tan lento 😳 ES COMO OPENINGLISH PERO EN ESPAÑOL JAJSJJAJQJQJAA ¿Por qué estoy viendo esto si soy Mexicana? JAJAJAJAJA sólo he venido a ver como suena esto en español, no podía con la curiosidad dios mio por que esta mujer habla muyyy rapido???!?!?! no le entiendo Me preguntaba cómo eran los listening en Español xd ahora ya salí de duda.Si necesitan ayuda con su español con gusto me ofrezco. LA MUJER TIENE VOZ DE ODIAR SU TRABAJO JSHSHSHSHS En español es demasiado raro JAJSKAJAJAJAK Wow con que asi les enseñan español  :0 Not only is this not a beginner level listening exercise, but it’s about buying necklaces? It’s such a strange situation for a beginner to learn and a beginner Spanish speaker is never going to jump right into buying Necklaces. Beginner listening should not only be with easier to understand, very standard but can still be strong, Spanish accents. But also, beginner listening should be about situations where they might find themselves in. A listening exercise on how to buy food or how to buy a bus ticket, or how to listen to directions. These are things that beginners might come across, if they travel to Spain for example. The women’s accent is one thing, probably belongs in an intermediate levels because once you understand enough words then you can be introduced to how different accents and dialects will say those words. But buying a necklace for you wife’s birthday? How many people is that going to apply to who are learning Spanish? $900 pesos un collar de perlas , es muy barato 😂 so so helpful for gcses!!!! thankyou sm Nadie habla así de lento en español Joder aquí en España ya nadie habla así what beginner spanish speaker is learning about fixing printers? lol This is more so for intermediate Jajajajajajaja y yo creyendo que los listening de inglés eran horrorosos. there are so many 'o' sound !Hola Chicos! I dont understand spanish is never translated wors for word... My brain does back flips when i turn off rearanging sentences mode 😂 Omg I watched this once months ago and didn't get anything. I've been working at spanish over the quarantine for months practicing and I come back to this months later and I understand 85% of what's been said. I'm so happy lmao. Stay consistent guys. I have a long way to go but glad I've made progress This for a beginner?  Wow, sorry to disappoint you, but you need to start waaay slower and increase slowly over time. Porque los listening en English no se entienden na y español refacil amigo I challenged a native spanish speaker to understand this part 18:48 but even he couldnt understand the mumblings of the woman (7:15) (4:45) Muchas gracias por este ejercicio! Lol entendí todo, ah cierto hablo español I'm new to youtube.  Any love/criticism would be appreciated. 
https://youtu.be/t4DmImh38tU En donde ? o donde ? I am from spain and this is not for begginers Yo hablo español e inglès intermedio. Cualquiera que desee aprender español le puedo ayudar:D claro, tambièn necesito aprender inglès haha 😎 For those who are beginners or intermediate like me, I’ve found that it helps to focus on one conversation. I will go through one conversation and listen to it, read it, and then write it down in Spanish and English and write words that I have learned. Then I will speak the entire conversation in Spanish after getting a good understand of what is being said. Then just continue to repeat the process of listening and speaking the conversation. Until you can listen to the whole conversation and understand exactly what is being said. Just thought it might help some people out here who have struggle learning Spanish like me haha. beginners: I'm not even a beginner...?! For all the people who keep saying this is too fast. Change the playback speed to 0.75 (or even 0.5). I'm a beginner and I can understand it much better at a slower speed. Es :¿qué collar va a comprar? No cual
Soy española😀😀 Esty aprndeindo a havlar en espanol algien me aiuda It is hard for a beginner, but if you set the playback speed to 0.75, I find it makes a huge difference! I went from understanding basically nothing to almost everything. Tenía mucha curiosidad de ver como eran los listening de español 
I'm a native Spanish speaker. 
La verdad es que este audio no es para un beginner. It's more like a advance After about 2 weeks studying spanish I can understand about 75-80%... Amazing lesson for listening comprehension and reinforcement. <333 Slowing the playback speed to .75 me ha ayudado mucho. I am from mexico. And this isn´t for beginners. This is advanced vocabulary I have been learning Spanish for a month. It is my first listening exercise and I understand about 90 por ciento. It's a Mexican spanish not is a normaly spanish 難しい〜 Klk acho eto no se etende mi loko, se entende - q un qlo
Hayy por la rasaa q no lo e entendio ni yo q soy de albacete Probably the words are beginners but the pronunciation speaking is above beginner, I can translate the words when reading but listening very difficult. El hombre: "Yo hablo muy claro."

La mujer: "Unhomresestallamqueaño." are you sure, this one is for beginners? The woman who is talking doesn't know speak spanish very well xddddddd Like si hablas español pero tenías curiosidad de como era un listening español XD Mhmmm creo que pa muy principiantes a las justas entenderan algo xd Soy hablate nativo de español
¿puedo ayudar a alguien ?
Tambien quiero que me ayuden con mi ingles Porque no hablan español de españa?😂 This woman's accent and pronunciation should not be used for beginner lessons. I can understand everything the man says but only 30% what the woman says. The volume is too low. la narradora estaba pasando un mal día xd the lack of any emotion whatsoever throws me off so bad Alguien más que ya sabe español, pero igual está viendo esto por curiosidad? Jajaja Solemos decirles CD, no DVD I didn't have much problems because Italian and Spanish are very similar, but this is definetly near impossible to understand for someone who doesn't speak neolatin languages Realmente me gusta esto video

Its been two months and I can get half of these words.. This will really help me Veo esto para asegurarme de que no se me olvidó hablar español. I am looking for videos from Mexico. I hear there is a big difference between Mexico and Spain. I will never be in Spain but will be in Mexico. Have no interest in Spainish Menuda gramática Creo que esto no es para principiantes, es demasiado para ellos.

https://youtu.be/UTG4EDjZfRE Nowadays you need to use Zoom or similar to learn a language. I'm thinking of signing up to one of those courses https://www.happylanguages.co.uk/italian-courses-london/ Molto grazie 🙏 ♥️ Sto imparando l'italiano  io parlo spagnolo ma la teacher non e'italiana Ciao a tutti, ho bisogno di imparare la lingua italiana Thank you for doing this without charging money ❤️ I was born in the Philippines but my last name is Italian so I'm here to learn Italian What is the difference between: Tu sei and Voi siete? I was trying to spell my name when I realized there's no L. XD My mom is Italian background but she doesn’t speak Italian. I’m trying to learn it. Should I Go Back And Watch Netflix? dove ce  'L' cosa sucesso Too fast, muy rapido por mi. La professoressa parla italiano meglio di me :) Where’s lesson twooo Perché sono italiana e sto guardando questo video? An ad every two minutes is a bit much. Especially during a language lesson. Ugh. L???????? Graize Eccelente! Sto imparando a parlare l'italiano da poco per me. Mi hai piaciuto un casino questa video! Saluti dal Messico Ciao ¡ Perché hai smesso di fare video ??? Hi. İ am 17 and trying to learn italian. İs there anyone who can help me in their free times by speaking with me on insta🥰ps i am girl👏👏👏 Spanish is not easy but made easy. Thanks for such a great teacher who has done this job very well. I can't believe that it's free😶❤ This is how we count sometimes in Hiligaynon buy with a different spelling and pronunciation. This is great but, some different pronunciations to what I'm used to in Spain. C was pronounced th, & Z sometimes th, different parts of Spain, different accents. Mmmm thats difficult! Filipinos are killing this :D this is how we count haha its easy for me to learn spanish because im filipino. some of our words are from español. our calendars, days, weeks and numbers are in spanish Need more content from this teacher if possible. We use cien only when we re saying 100 not 100 and something. Bisaya is waving! Gracias El profesor This teacher is sooooo good. This is how we count numbers in Cebuano/bisaya, from Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭 Excellent maestra Bravo my best Spanish teacher You are fantastic For those curious of what goes higher than a million:

Virtually all Spanish countries officially use the "long scale" for counting instead of the short scale, where each term after "million" doesn't grow by 10^3, but by 10^6. For example, we in English would say "billion" and that would be a thousand millions. But in Spanish "billón" would be a MILLION millions. With that in mind, this table below extends to a quintillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 10^18.

1,000,000,000 - billion = mil millón
1,000,000,000,000 - trillion = billón
1,000,000,000,000,000 - quadrillion = mil billón
1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - quintillion = trillón Bisaya here. Gracias! At 9.44, please explain the inconsitency with cientoveinte Y cinco when 25 is veinticinco. Is the answer "that´s just the way it is!" ? This teacher really is the best. I’m going through each video with sincere interest and genuine progress. He makes it so easy to understand. I love these lessons, thank you so much for sharing this completely free. Really nice to listen to you and learn alone with you . A great way to learn a language and to remember what you learn . Have a great day everyone Understanding the Spanish language will become a critical skill for future employment. To help provide the necessary education a link to this video has been included on the DR-KNOW.biz website -- index and keywords by INFORMATION SPECIALIST * Todd Wheatley Filipino : oh this is easy.  
uno dos tres . . .

Guy:  diez

.. Yung may mga spanish na salita ka palang alam pero mali lang ang bigkas .. Spanish Learn help me butter teacher Dr Danny hola Buenas tarde para que no Gracias por todo lo bendiga siempre Llamós llámame I think in most cases, people teach spanish with the madrid accent (th instead of s) I find it interesting that you choose otherwise. Love your efforts by the way, great content! Old lady here studying Spanish for the first time... whew! Glad you're on here! thank you for videos. i am learning spanish and this makes it so much easier. You're amazing and very much appreciated. You're a great teacher Dr.Evans.I wish i had a teacher like you for german I really like the way you're teaching, sir. Make me understand well. Thanks so much :) Excellent 👌 and smart teacher All the counting number in spanish is the same with my native language. Majority of my language is the same with spanish, this might be the cause of colonization during Spaniards/spanish colonization 👌☺️ you have become an addition to my bag of resources, questions -why didn't you accent 22,23 & 26? its filipino numbers haha! Bro this is the best teaching online. Thank you 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 dude. I speak spanish as a native language. I am from colombia. that explanation about cincuenta, setenta and noventa blew my mind. holy mother of good. It makes much more sense to say" Siete-cientos" for nonspeakers of spanish, but we say SETEcientos. wow, I have never thought of that. that is amazing. I wonder how much more strange things has this beautiful language. You are amazing. by the way I was following all your instructions hehehehe. repeating numbers. loved it.

What an amazing teacher!!! Perfecto ..mushas gracias Pitbull taught me how to count from 1 to 3 in Spanish Puñeta!You are a great teacher. Would you state a phone number the same way he did the large number ? I want to learn Spanish so that I can talk to my grandchildren when they come. Son in law is Spanish descent and they want to teach their children to be bilingual. I started with Rosetta Stone but it was frustrating not having an English translation of the words, especially with the tenses. Dr. Evans is the best! Muchas gracious, Dr. Evans. luvvvvvvvvvv...... yur teaching Mr. Evans(with a high five from the Caribbean!)...if u weren't a teacher i could hv mistaken u for a natural spanish speaker.   P.S.I love the facts at the end of the episodes. iGracias! Dr.  Evans, you have taught me more in seven videos than I was able to 
understand in a few weeks.  Your teaching style is so easy to grasp and 
very engaging.  I feel so much better about my beginner skills.  Great 
job, and keep the videos coming! When he says “it’s that easy” I feel so warm and fuzzy. 😉 Hehe Has anyone felt the Dora the explora theme because of the vid? La misma regla para millones aplica para bendiciones. Muy bueno, me ayuda con el inglés. Gracias. This is a TEACHER! Just can' t pull myself from the screen. Thanks a lot, sir.

Edit: I stole his ez homework Hats off sir it's really very interesting class sir☺️ Spanish is the best  I'm gonna try Latin to Your idea with the charts makes it so easy to understand, you deserves lots of credit for posting these videos for free. The best Spanish teacher on YouTube. I am so happy I came across this guy! Because I grew up in the Philippines, Spanish numbers were thought to me when I was very young. Lucky to get through this lesson about numbers in a breeze! Thank u ...your classes are interesting and helpful 1) 26 veintiséis, the 2nd e should be stressed? But 6 just regular e.
2) Teacher with Dr before your name, is it common in Spain to salute teacher like that? Thanks 09:45  should i say 125 as ciento veinticinco or ciento veinte y cinco as you said here? This episode is easy for me because we use the same counting here in Philippines.🇵🇭 I've read this comment before, but I have to say it again, you Sir are the best teacher ever! You should get an award! I am just a little confused. So my question is, for example, saying 37. Would you say "treinta  siete" or "trienta y siete"? Do you only add the "y" when saying 137? Pause at any moment and look at his face. filipinos can relate from egypt thank you very much Dr. Evans https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GFwrcNlXh92xA8iKFT2WA/videos
This is teacher offical channel! Check on that too! I  Really get confused when to use accent on "LETTER ".....

"ya" pronounce as "ja" nice Thank you so much. Your method works perfectly.  Thanks to you I've been learning so many new vocabularies everyday.


Loves from Turkey :* Gracias por todo , eres el mejor maestro. Hola, how come there are two versions of como - with and without accents? Muchas gracias, Paul! porque no das  la  form ''vosotros'   de todos  los   verbos? I really enjoy the way you teach this--giving us vocab, asking us to compose a phrase,  giving us time to answer on our own, then then letting us both see and hear the correct answer--and pronunciation!  Thank you!  This is enjoyable and effective! Que difícil es aprender inglés 
Yo quiero aprended esa lengua Amazing lesson. You got a new subscriber! Wow Paul.... What a easy way you thought us🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Muchas gracias No Vosotros/Usted....?
probably best to not confuse latin american spainish learners i suppose but good to be aware of it. If anyone knows, by chance, the title of the guitar music at the end of each episode, please let me know? Por favor... Que genial ... gracias a Paul I'm a native Spanish speaker, what am I doing here? XD Mucho gracious Great job Anyone search this up because you guys have an exam tomorrow? Spaniards use "refaccion" for repair.  They also seem to use a lot more pronouns that Mexicans and Central Americans. A lot more. Having said that, I think that your teaching method is marvelous. Oh, yes! Your lesson makes it simple!!! Mutchassssssssss graciasssss Yesss!!!!! I love this lesson. Gracias :) Hubiere preferido que me suribellase con sus interesantes vocablos españoles . Paul, you really make it easy and interesting. Thanks. why are you dropping the el, la, tu, yo, nos (nosotros) before the verb?  I don't understand ,  I have never heard anyone say "se" instead of " yo se" or Sabes instead of "tu sabes".  Is it because there is a complete sentence involved? I'm taking spanish lessons & was taught arreglar also means to fix, or arrange. Because of u am understanding Spanish structure much better thanks ....is there any one who will like to practice spanish with me ? I will be so greatful Gracias Paul quiero aprender español perfect video! sí, esto ayudará a las personas que no saben español i am around Hispanic people all the time i love them they love me. i try to speak with them. do you how Tom cruise sound in the movie American made with his Spanish when he try use his little vocabulary at them. my Spanish friends said that's me and they always said i will speak Spanish I'm always trying. as you guys can see what am doing in here?  the battle will never end until i speak it. great course.

Leer is an app for iPhone that teaches you how to read Spanish, associating the sounds of the letters and their combinations will help you know how to read a word, you will have a list of words with frequent sounds and some sentences formed with those words, you will hear letters, syllables, words and sentences, then the repetition and practice will help you to progress.

 Nice pronunciation  i appreciate ur efforts but u spouse teach non Spanish speaker  so how can i understand u while u r talking in Spanish?      The problem is most teachers, classes and courses overlook the best ways to start speaking Spanish quickly. Instead they insist on teaching you minor points of grammar that have little or no effect on your ability to communicate...Learning Spanish right here..  *onlinespanishcourses.uphero.* *com* No entiendo lo que dices que hablo inglés sólo digo esto con traducir in any video Por que razon aparece la ( Ñ).

thanks again Muchas Gracias y Respecto --From-- Marruecos  Sí que existe , que no lo sepas es otra cosa. The letters S - C - Z in Spanish are pronounced the same.

when written, must taking into account the grammar rules .

In a book/Internet/teacher you can learn it Gracias a tí por verlos:) Gracias publicar este video
 No existe español "estándar". Hay muchos acentos y todos forman el idioma español.  wooo hoo i studied spanish!!! oye hum indians ko kuch sikhado bhai! en Chile también.  La W es "doble ve". B es "be larga" y V "ve corta". En otros lugares son "be alta" y "u ve". Saludos. I'm a native speaker, so I can help you with that. In standard Spanish, that is, Spanish spoken by most speakers, "C" is pronounced like an S when before E or I and like a K when before A, O and U. "LL" and "Y" are pronounced the same and don't have an exact equivalent in English. The closest sounds are a stronger "Y" and a softer "J" because the precise sound is sort of in the middle. I recommend you to listen carefully to the teacher when he/she pronounces words with "LL" and "Y" and exercise. I jak ci szlo?  Its method of teaching is the same as in Poland. When I studied in Poland, they taught polish language in polish. They want us to learn as a baby, and absorb little by little Yo no entiendo espanol. I don't understand Spanish Gracias a tí por ver los vídeos! Un saludo desde Madrid. Pilar find audios of michel thomas..and then come here..it's in english and it's great :) yo soy de argentina se hablar español loco Permiteme que te corrija ;-) "me llamo Daniel y desearia aprender espanol -perdona, mi teclado NO es espanol :-( -  Hablo un poco espanol porque tengo familia que vive en Espana. Muchas gracias por esta film...
YO ESTO TE LO HAGO GRATIS, NO SOY PROFESORA, PERO HABLO ESPANOL ! Hasta la vista :-) Disculpa, pero en Latinoamérica(al menos en mi país Argentina) la V es conocida como "ve" y la W es conocida como "Doble Ve", solo una aclaración.
Saludos. I'm suprised that the whole lesson is in Spanish. How am I supposed to know what is being said? Please do a video in English, teaching how to speak in Spanish. Bottom line: it seems you're teaching Spanish speaking people how to speak the Spanish language. :(
 hola :-) you should show annonation in english
 totalmente de acuerdo con la LL/Y, la verdadera pronunciación de la LL es 'lateral palatal' sin embargo actualmente casi todos los dialecticos del español tanto europeos (españa) como americanos son yeístas, salvo casos concretos

pero en el caso de la V, debo decirte que en español estandar no existe (foneticamente hablando) vaso y baso (del verbo basar) se pronuncian igual, es decir no existe en español normado la labiodental V, es un error muy frecuente quizas por imitacion del Fr, Ing.... Hola Daan, si quieres estudiar español, escríbeme a escuela@tildemadrid.es y te informaré de cómo puedes estudiar  en nuestra escuela TILDE en Madrid o via skype!!
 Un saludo y muchas gracias por tu interés, Pilar. hola spanishsesson.

 muy gracias para este cine!! 
 learn spanish here!
 t i n y u r l DOT com / a l 4 m o q 8 I love this video. Saludos desde Hungría!:) Yes, You need to know the alphabet first but it is important to start speaking from the beginning with the help of a teacher. In Spanish we only capitalize proper nouns. that is the same technic my teacher uses :) bu video da nesleri birebir  gösterib anlatması        çok güzel la W depende del país por ejemplo acá de donde soy la W se dice (doble ve) Aca le decimos doble v a la w En España la W es uve doble. ¿Tú de dónde eres, Luis? w es (doble u ) no es uv doble inche sonsa ¿Que la B/V y la LL/Y se pronuncian igual? Que el yeismo esté más que extendido no significa que representen el mismo sonido. Tampoco hay distinción a nivel conversacional entre B y V, pero una es labial y la otra labiodental, representando sonidos ligeramente diferentes.

Para castellano básico está bien la explicación, pero eso de que se pronuncian igual no es del todo cierto... Muchas gracias!  Thank you very much!
if you need Spanish classes, we can help you via skype! In Spanish we only write proper names in capital letters. It's more or less like in English, but days of the week, months, nationalities and languages are written in lower case letters.
Cheers from Barcelona. Hola. Muchos Gracias Srta.Sra thank god I'm filipino, since we speak some spanish words, I actually understand it a little :)

Pedro tiene una mamá, Pedro tiene un papá, Pedro tiene un hermano. Pedro ama a su familia. ¿Y tu la Amas ?

I´m a spanish native. My english is a little bad, but I hope you practice with this sentence. Good luck



T R A S L A T I O N

Pedro has a mom, Pedro has a dad, Pedro has a brother. Pedro loves his family. And you love her? After getting known that Spanish's gonna be the most using language by the year of 2050, I came to listen to how it sounds. I don't know; maybe I'm the only one but it seems so not beautiful and empty. Really. Cool After reading comments, this short stories are not for beginners. Damn click bait jerk...lol 0:30 for personal utilisation only 😊 so not for beginners I gave up on 3rd page... I'm worse than I thought 😡 I'd suggest keeping a translator open and searching the words you don't know. It may take some time but at least you'll learn some new words +understand the story;) Easy??? It's going way to fast to translate the comments are all about how people are realising they're actually shit at spanish but it's the other way around for me i did not expect to understand this i've impressed myself 😭 To fast which spanish accent is this? good level but too long... was fun When u don't Spanish but ur a Filipino-  *cries in confusion and because some of it are funny* in our language* Great Video 😊
Can I get the book and a
CD audio 54 seconds en el video,
Me doy cuenta.. no sé mierda I am a spanish tutor in Preply I can help you to understand that :P surprisingly i knew 90% of this. They should have added the English translation so we could also improve comprehension 0:35 I'm so happy that i can understand 99% of this😭🤩 gg bro no comprendo Adjust video speed to .75x and it helps quite a bit ! I've been putting in hours and duolingo and it's doing good for me so far I already knew some but I should be fluent in Spanish in 3 to 4 months. But also have spanish coworkers i practice with and listen to. LOL the only way this is beginner is if it's for native speaking children (who are really well read at home) ahaha yes Muy buen video pero en 1:15 dice hembras y varones y está mal expresado ya que hembras y/o Machos son para referirse a los animales No way is this for beginners - much too difficult I don't think that was short Este is muy dificil. There goes my bubble I remember listening to this 2 years ago, I knew nothing. Today I know half! 🙃 Dweeb . Wtf I did it understand anything lmfao😭 Muy fàcil, subanle la dificultad 😅 when you think you are crushing duolingo and then, you lose hope.... no one
absolutely nobody
native speaker: because I'm here if I'm a native speaker I can't imagine a child's book being read this fast!  Maybe Spanish isn't for me after all. How are we supposed to learn Please why can’t this audio be interpreted I suggest that you coloring the words you reading. We lost while you are reading..!! 1:34 ESTO NO ES PARA PRINCIPIANTES.
NO TE DESANIMES, SIGUE APRENDIENDO A TU RITMO. This is not anywhere near beginner with the speed and words used. This is advanced apart from speed which is as fast as most Spanish people speak yo bien feliz porque veo que los que hablan inglés no entienden al igual que cuando yo estoy tratando de entender inglés jajaaj los comprendo:( Keep in mind folks, when they use the term 'beginner' in Spanish, they mean someone who has probably taken at least 3 or 4 semesters of Spanish, and can conjugate in the present tense, and have a working vocabulary of at least a few thousand words. I know this is „slow reading“ but this is still to hard for beginners. los que hablan español pero buscaron como  leer en español xD me vale un kilo de verga la historia de fito jajajaja xd Estoy no entiendo . Ese bideo es no para beginner. I partially understood the first two pages. 😐 Even though this isn’t a beginner story, I still found it helpful for learning new vocabulary by translating the story to english Casi me rindo hasta que me reuní con FREDRICHACK en IG, quien me ayudó a recuperar mi cuenta de Instagram. Muchas gracias a FREDRICHACK 💝 me gusto mucho esta historia, era muy interesante y facil a entender. de irlanda! I'm a native speaker, what am i doing here? ✨I dont understand anything✨ Useless Why there is no translation? I doubt even the Spanish could understand this.. Lol why does the English summary at the end say it's a "cafeteria" that they go into? I know the Spanish word is "cafetería," but it's more like a cafe isn't it? It's frekin outside, next to a park, and has waiters working at it, what the heck kind of cafeteria would that be lol I lately discovered this reading tutorial last March. Since then, my very own boy and I were truly serious in working with the guide. Presently, my toddler can read books without my help. He is today in his Pre-school and also he is extremely comfortable in his classes. Research about this reading book by Google. The program’s name is Elena Readoρiz
Good who watching this in 2020 only because your spanish teacher tell u to whyyyyyyy Ohhhh! I thought I'd progressed - not so much! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ im beginners though but i can un derstand however there are words that i can’t understand ..so this is not beginners friendly I agree that the level is higher. Perhaps after 3 more months of practice I will come back to try again I agree, i m upper intermediate level and it s ok for me Guys this is not for beginners 🙂..if you want learn perfectly you should use duolingo app which will help to the most Vamos a aprender español. Oh espera, ese es mi idioma- fee-dough is a real piece of shit in this story For beginners my ass.... I really enjoyed it! I didn’t understand most of the details, but I was so happy because I did comprehend the major details and plot of the story, which is great! Thank you, it’s a wonderful content! Maybe not for beginners though, as I have already studied Spanish for 2 years in school and extra studies on my own at home. Thanks anyways, very helpful! ¡Demasiado rápido! My attempt at the first page after thinking I knew shit on duo... Pedrito a boy travelled to 7 something, decided to take a walk through the park. Something something dog called Fido. Fido is large, the colour white and has brown spots?... Can't even make out the rest. Certainly not for beginners. I can read and translate very well, but deciphering conversations is so hard. I definitely need to practice more listening Beunas noches,mucho gusto - Duolingo learners hit 'em up I don’t think this is for beginners because if I heard this story 7 months ago I would not understand much, but  I have been studying Spanish for the last 7 months and I understood most of the story with few new Vocabs that I  understood with context. A nice little story:) This is not for beginners. The strong inhaling breath is quite distracting. here's  several tips for how to learn Spanish
Decide exactly why you wish to learn Spanish
Try to use Spanish everyday
Decide which process works for you best.
(I read about these and more on Fergs Spanish Blueprint site ) There are  a few suggestions for how to learn Spanish
Decide precisely why you wish to learn it
Try to use Spanish everyday
Decide which method works for you the best.
(I read about these and more from Fergs spanish blueprint website ) I have spent months researching into learning Spanish quickly and discovered a great resource at Fergs spanish blueprint (check it out on google) I don't know if this is Beginner or not since I'm not in a Spanish class yet (8th grade) But I want to be the best in Spanish class I like this book!!! Please help me in learning Spanish Definitely NOT for beginners. Subjunctive tenses (present and imperative), complex sentences with too many adverbs and adjectives. Result is constant reference to a dictionary. Complex verbs with double pronouns. No repetition of vocabulary from one story to another. (Important if you are learning to have recurrent words and phrases). If you have a complete grasp of verb structure in most tenses and a reasonably good vocabulary, you will be okay. But it is a deceit to call this a beginners book. More like a reading book for pre-university students studying Spanish. Shame on Lingo Mastery. ¡Hola a todos (as)! Soy mexicano y les puedo decir que este audiolibro definitivamente no es para principiantes, quizá es para un nivel intermedio alto, pues ya usan un vocabulario extenso y complejo. 
Así que no se estresen ni se preocupen porque no entienden nada, poco a poco aprenderán. ¡Ánimo y mucho éxito! 
Actualmente yo estoy aprendiendo inglés y francés, y cuando escucho y leo audiolibros en francés tampoco entiendo nada, así que supongo que es igual. This is a SHORT story?  Que fuerte!! ¡Que suerte!  Entendí casi todo. I understand some of the words cuz I'm a Filipino and the words are similar to tagalog ^_^ Me puse a ver esto para ver qué tal son los listening en español en gringolandia y casi me muero de risa xdd Oh shit i take a look at this story i think its for the kids but this a loong story and is not easy for beginners .
Im arabic and i want learn this a great languge it's not for beginners, but i'm an intermediary so i understood the story pretty well. This is cool thanks! Look at it this way if this is beginner we have good aspirations for our language learning ...I can understand like 90% If I read along while listening I can follow it even though there are a lot words I don't know.   If I close my eyes and only listen i get lost pretty quick. Me: Oh for begginers!

Would like to have some friends to improuvge my espanish Still a little unclear on how you switched from sus to Ellis at the end. How do you differentiate from  using sus or Ellos/ellas? Too much talking only......you need to WRITE IT Down so visual people can also follow not just auditory. This lesson was most ineffective so far! Does anyone wants to be friends, so we can learn spanish together and talk? Thank you so much! I have been studying Spanish for three months now and you have been very helpful indeed. This was a very good class Here in the Philippines. I always get called by the elderly "hijo". I didn't know what it means at first. But Espanol blood is still strong in the Philippines! thank you so much Como siempre, muchas gracias Dr Dan. Del Dr Lee. H is silent . But why then it is being  used?   soy Indio .. Vivo en Mumbai[Bombay] Hablo pocco espanol https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GFwrcNlXh92xA8iKFT2WA/videos

How is my spanish XD I want to impress MAMACITAS. So I learn Spanish It is helping me so I can speak to Spanish people thank you fort sharing your video, it was confusing and annoying when you do extra talk and when you say the lower frase first or saying the right side first Obsessively Oversmart Thank you Mi favorito video de su! gracias señor! excelente! Always a great lesson. Debo que ir a España y conocerte. Preparando ir a MX y usando tus videos. Saludos! Señor! If I could get all these phrases down I would have it made! 33:03 Pomegranate -  pom. ee - gran - it 12:02 -  I know you're doing direct translation, but in English we would say: "My grandfather *has* gone fishing" rather than "is gone" :) Me gusta esto!  Perfect for my level right now.  The incidental comments about alternative phrases, what's used most often, etc. are very helpful.  Gracias! Funny Guy. What happen at 37:10 on the video? Seems your gone a trip to Christmas without explanation? This is excellent!  Very useful! Excellent sentences for beginners to learn Spanish..thank you for this...but if you give nombre to every sentence like..1,2,3,...etcetera..then we can right and understand correctly and that's why we don't miss any sentences... Great video thanks you very much I'm Liberian/African learning Spanish, I love the music, food and woman so why not learn the language🤷. ¡Toc Toc! I'm an obsessive!  Toc Toc, también, es una película muy buena. Jaja!  Gracias a Laurent Baffie y Vicente Villanueva, y a actores brillantes. Pero tu sabes esto, yo creo.   -  I've seen it three times, English subtitles and I've read the Spanish transcript. It's good for listening skills, but the actors speak so quickly! Phew! necesitamos ver tu cara... Haha, good lesson 🙂 Pablo, ¡Tio! Los trens, los Po Po's y los cláxones de coches, ¡no te preocupes ! Ellos son más divertidos! Mantienes el buen trabajo! Saludos de inglaterra. Maybe to your girlfriend in the morning! 😂😂😂 Estoy grande en la mañana 🤣🤣 very different from latin american spanish Hola 😚teahcer u good teacher thanks for everything but eating pig is not allowed by Allah(God) for some reasons. 17:18 I got it so quickly! Thank you! from the looks of it someone ate the teacher last night ;) Hoy, compre cuatro manzanas rojas y des tomates de cerezas I am happy to have found you teacher. I've been watching you for only 3 days and got a clear vision of structure and rules. You are perfect in teaching and tips. I could't imagine to get a picture in only 3 days. Spanish is my 5th language and I will stick to it. I am really happy to have started with you. Thanks a million times... I got confused when I saw me gustan before. And I was like me is singular. why gustan? This explains the confusion. Thanks so much At 14:48 isnt it gustan and not gusta Thank  you Professor! You're such a perfect & patient teacher! Bless you! I now properly understand gustar, thanks! I really like the way you teache spanish Note: so verb or adjective takes the plural not according the count of person. me gustais tu. is this sentence correct? I really love how in this lecture series grammar is taught as we go along. I think most people in the US at some point try to learn spanish off and on through the years, myself included. Without a good teacher you are forced to do this by books, tapes, and increasingly apps that don't teach you spanish as a language but instead teach you spanish as a set of words and phrases to be memorized, which is very disheartening because you spend so much time and effort memorizing so many random words/phrases and despite all your effort you feel like you don' t understand anything because you aren't taught grammar and sentence structure until later and by that point you lose motivation. This lecture series/teacher is great because you really feel like you're making progress and that your effort is being rewarded as you learn. We need more language teachers like this! This teacher is excellent! His every explanation is so clear and easy to learn Spanish! Thank you Is this reverse thing just for "gustar" verb? Why do you have 2 peas 🤔🤔 why does he have a hickey lmao You are a great teacher! Its very easy to learn Spanish with you sir.  Gracias A long time ago I went to Ecuador and I ate a cuy..Do you  know ? ..I hope you inderstand my english isn’t Very good.Thanks for your lessons Best way of teaching...

To help provide the necessary education a link to this video has been included on the DR-KNOW.biz website -- index and keywords by INFORMATION SPECIALIST * Todd Wheatley I want to thank you because you are so cheerful that I am getting more and more encouraged day by day. Do you have to use El if you just wanna say the word or do you not have to add it? I always thought spanish is hard but this teacher make it easy for me 👍👌👍 This teacher is amazing my order taker at Taco Bell was not amused tomatoes is also jitomate.

Teacher is handsome is really important, that is why I follow this man. He is sexy. In Mexico “almuerzo” is a heavy breakfast. 🍳 What for Americans is ‘lunch’ for us it’s ‘La comida’ and that’s the main meal of the day, usually served between 2-3 pm. And here we don’t use the word ‘vegetales’, we say “verduras”. 🙃 Dios a Bendiga señor y mi profesor. Muchas para por hoy clase. Joel from India. Iam not a native Spanish speaker,  i just listened his first class curiously and i impressed with Spanish language.

I do say, learning your videos along with Babbel is a great combination but if anyone should be charging anyone its you not Babbel. La carne es en BISTEC no biFtec Gracias!! Thanks Teach so much las naranjas is like narangi  orange in hindi "Gustar" it was really difficult to understand opposite value of its meaning, but looks like I'm fine after this lesson.

Thanks Great lesson as always Have been wishing to learn Spanish years ago and now I have finally decided to start. I found this YouTube channel like 2 months ago, it's very beneficial and helpful, the teacher is great and have very easy and clear method to deliver the lesson. Thanks a lot♥️👌 love you so much sir this kind of teaching will be easier to learn any language I like your eay of teaching I hope sooner I will be able to learn Spanish💜 i always look forward to the cultura part Didn’t he just say the opposite, he just changed it back! Frijoles and guisantes equals peas? I thought frijoles was beanz!

My first language is hindi and second english and i m too trying to learn spanish from u tube only and ur lessons are clear and easy☺☺ How to say I dislike 🤔 Just want you to know that I am conducting there Spanish Summer Language Club with the grandchildren this summer. We will be using your topic of Spanish food! Great video! I've never heard of biftec (steak), I heard of bistec (steak). At 14:57 shouldn't it be " Les gustan el arroz" instead of "Les gusta el arroz"? 2:31 little typo, "beans" not "peas" 😁 you make spanish a lot funnier and easier to learn! muchas gracias ❤️ This dear chap is a rather splendid tutor of this particular foreign language. Hussars to you kind Sir. The other forms of gustar are also important, for example "me gustas tu". I am really enjoying the lessons at the moment. I would like to let you know that in the lesson on "Food", you have put down the spanish for "Beans" as "Peas" as well. You make the lessons so so easy. Thank you so so much... This lesson is a little challenging but still you explained it so well. I love learning with you.. waiting for more episodes.. Yo gustan sandiás, do tú gustan sandiás? Beautiful. Thank you. Nice content I like the pace in the lesson and it makes learning easy. I especially agree with you that we all have our own ways to learn a new language. Thank you. Spanish foods look amazing! Why are you not using Ella for she? If you want to say, She likes fish - can we not say Ella gusta el pescado? the very best tips comes at the end😅😅😅 thanks for sharing your knowledge!! Keep up the good work👍🏻 your lecture is very impressive This teacher is the best teacher of Spanish. God bless you. And what about the gusto,gustas,gustamos...
We don't need to use it or what ??? thank you for the birth  of beanos in Spanish cultures long live the frijole I am learning this as my fifth language... Thank you for making it easier to understand and enjoyable! I love learning, love culture and languages, thank you for the lessons, they do please me In this time of corona virus and " StayHome" order , I am trying to learn Spanish as my 5th language. Your lessons are easy and clear ....  muchas gracias . I rarely hear it in English, but it's the closest to Gustar usage, and that's "I'm pleased with it/them." Hi I’m currently in lockdown in Scotland and thought this would be a good opportunity to lean Spanish, at times I’m struggling but the way Danny teaches the language and being able to stop and listen over again it’s terrific. Thanks a Millon. Tommy when to use me/te/le/nos/os/les instead of yo/tu/el or ella?????? I started to learn Spanish and he is the best teacher! Great teacher that was very helpful thank you so much. Have a good time learning everyone This is why it's good to use more than one resource to learn a language because I was a bit confused on this part in Duolingo, but now i'm going to move ahead much easier.   Duolingo is a great source for learning a language but this guy is the icing on the cake, thank you!!This is my first time watching your videos, and based on your brilliant teaching method, I thought that you have tens of thousands of subscribers. I wish you all the best (: .

Is it hard to learn Spanish? I came from the northern part of the Philippines called the Latin city of Asia. My place is called Zamboanga, and we speak a creole dialect which is called chavacano, it's the dialect created when the spanish went to the PH. And we chavacano speakers can understand almost 3/4 of Spanish language. It's just the accent that is deep Hola Señor, Gracias! Your teaching approach is by far the best and effective! More power to you! 11:16 how to pronounce rr ? I have been practicing this sound for almost 20 years, but I still can't pronounce it. Somebody help me please~ New subscriber here!

So what should I say in v, ve or u-ve  and what should I say in w doble-u or doble-ve.I'm so sorry for the trouble, and by the way thank you so much for this, this is a great help (*^_^*) Okay I’m seeing a lot of  similarities between Hindi alphabets and Spanish ones here .

Your videos have been tremendous help. Thank you. daddy evans .vosotros es caliente It really helps. Wow, Gracias Happy Birthday!! Dr Danny Evans.

Don't forget to subscribe and click the notification bell. Thank you for watching the AIB Network! We hope your pursuit of learning the Spanish language is successful. You remembered a bow tie and socks, but forgot a dress. Now i wish he knew german so he could have teach it cause he is a great teacher Guys do you think these series are enough for A1 in Spanish? This should be the episode 8.5 don't be confused. Just continue to episode 7 and 8 then after the episode 8 this is the epiosde 8.5. In short there is no epiosde 6.5. Sir... In the sentence, why feminine form of green was not used? Thank you Wonderful Some say he still didn't find he didn't change the word yo llevo zapatos negros. Sir, why we don't add unos before word zapatos? Me staying here beacause of my Foreign Language subject. I think it will be much better to sort them up instead of bringing forward one by one for this episode does anyone know why he pronounced 'falda' like 'farda'? I literally just watch these videos to learn, nothing else because I just started// Great videos. Thank you very much the dress how? Understanding the Spanish language will become a critical skill for future employment. To help provide the necessary education a link to this video has been included on the DR-KNOW.biz website -- index and keywords by INFORMATION SPECIALIST * Todd Wheatley Why do we say "una blusA verdE", whereas it's una chaquetA negrA? Do we only change the endings O, and leave E unchanged in adjectives? I have to give credits to you, teacher..in my 33yrs here on earth🤣, you are the 2nd instructor in which I don't need(almost don't need) pen and paper to learn. I can almost retain in my 'brilliant little brain' your lessons just by watching and listening. I know the flea markets you're talking about in GA! My esposo introduced me to them, such as Plaza Fiesta and Pendergrass. I'm lucky that his first language is Spanish and we can practice together (even though he can't necessarily explain the grammatical rules to me), but these places are awesome to get in some real life experience.
