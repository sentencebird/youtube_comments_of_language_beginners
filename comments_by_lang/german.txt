reason im bored and also my grandfather is German Nobody Me :I want to learn German bcs I want to go to German to study😀 Thank you  so much  
Love you 😍
It is really very  very  helpful ☺ cuz hey 2 me  all of us are free to speak whatever language we please  and just cuz  lets say a german couple move to the  u.s.a   they are more than welcome 2 keep speaking their beautiful language if thats wat they want    :) well I'm wanting to acquire the german language just becuz  I too love different languages  and also should i ever meet a german person  that may be home sick 4 their native land  in this case germany i would want to   talk to them not in English  but in their language even if they know english too, i just feel that to me it would show them that i care much about their language to want to start studying it so that they wont feel so  lonely i guess thats what i am meaning. Ich Liebe Deutsch und ich liebe Deutschland auch  :)   yay  hahahaha German alphabet sound almost similiar with Indonesian alphabet sound only far diferent in J V and Y, litle diferent in Q and W sound. But german n Indonesia have realy diferent language The Ü in German sounds like the letter Y in Finnish. That's why it's easy for me to say that letter since i'm also learning Finnish. Thank you❤ The only reason,im learning german is,because, 
YOU UTTTERRRRR FOOOL GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! Danke! Teacher i really Apriciate your lesson (*´▽｀)ﾉﾉ In Indonesia we change j 'yot' with j 'je' (like English version) and change y 'ypsilon' with y 'ye'

Ja (Dutch) = Ya (Indonesia) So basically french pronunciation with english(ish) words? (ee) (yot) (kah) Super like 0:39 People when I do something remotely feminine I came here so I could sing WMID 😭 now I’m trying to pronounce ‘ERR’ right but I’m looking like a fool. I just started learning German and it's a fascinating language. Some of the alphabet is pronounced the same as in French. Makes it a little easier for me. It's cool that the letter Y almost sounds the same as in Italian. German sounds like a mixture of English and French in my opinion. I’m very late to this and I watched this for review because I have been learning German and you explained stuff way more understandable than me being in a group and not really understanding so thank you!! I lost my shit at orange 😂 Very useful video. Thank you! 8.8 cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 37 Selbsfahrlafette auf 18 ton Zugkraftwagen...
i know some german too Almost same with Indonesian pronounciation Geh looks like gay It's amazing how in our time we can learn anything faster, free and easier you don't need nothing just internet and YouTbe Watching after 7 years I write this all words in my copy Where is the "ü" letter This video makes it seem like German is just English with extra letters Rot (red) is so hard to say as someone with an American accent. Can't even say my favorite color in German. 🙄 15 Additionally it was the first of 12345678910111123141 vielen dank Learning German because I want to pursue my career in Germany 😁 Learning French and German wierd how close they are geographically wise but verbally so different The R (err) part got me chocking so hard learning german is making me too much laugh lol What is the meaning of chor I didn't understand pls tell Upsilon I feel like I am dead from Inside After seeing this I learnt little little german Native Urdu speaker

Hi everyone, I'm just started to learn German and want to know German grammar. For example Subject+V+Object in English. What about German.?
And Which one is more difficult (French and German)? When German is an aggressive language: https://youtu.be/Oy-cArjg3t0 Its similliar with indonesia waww I love Germany am in Germany I want to learn Thanks, Sunny Su! I've been struggling a lot since I came to Germany and now that I'm repeating 6th Grade here, I'd really like to learn this language since my mom isn't always by my side to teach me Deutsch, having the job of taking care to the people in a Home for The Aged, and because of just that, I,d really like to thank you again! When practicing pronouncing the German alphabet turns into NSFW for me because the pronunciation for I and J is inappropriate in my native language cuz it's like the ASL of F and G. Anyone in my house would probably ask me why I'm saying intercourse so loud not knowing that I'm practicing German 😂. I almost started to cry in frustration trying to pronounce "err" 😭 Is the pronunciation of ü she taught in this correct??? Because Google and other apps are giving different pronunciation for this.

I kinda don’t understand why people want to lean German, I speak German and honestly German is such a ugly language. Additionally to that it also has a difficult grammar, which I didn’t understand completely till the 6 grade, and mind that I lived my whole live speaking German. So if you are not a genius, it can take you many years until you can speak German fluently without hearing it in person single everyday My german dog:BARKBARK Me:TWT DAMIT WHATS SHUT UP IN GERMAN This video is enough to learn German, so good,  thank you so much.

I learnt french for 3 years but still I can't understand a single word
I think watching this 25 minutes video has taught me more German than learning French for 3 years 😂 Off topic, but why is English considered to be a Germanic language and not a romance language? i'm like 70% german but still don't know the language, tryna learn it now hallo ich heiße scheiße Me encantaaaa el mejor video que he visto, primera vez que entiendo ❤️❤️ Good Once upon a time on Deutsch Course

Had a friend from Germany that visited my country last year 
Amazing people
He could speak Afrikaans in only 5 months crazy so its my turn I love her.She is so German Tschuss!! 😋😂 Aha: Ein bisSchen!!!! The lesson on how to ask how much something costs brought back funny memory to me.  I was a high school student taking German in the early 80's.  Our teach asked us to write a short verbal exchange in the market.  Here was my Exchange:

Customer to Store clerk:  "Guten Tag. Kannst du mir deine apfel zeigen?  Wie viel Kosten Sie?"

The teacher laughed uncontrollably.  She had to explain it to me. Why did I even watch the full video while I am fluent in german xD Hi Laura! I want to see all your videos! I think you live near or in Bavaria. Because of your accent! So lovely!....I invite you to reply! ........john from minnesota Heigh falsghfhahasshs I am feeling dizzy danke Ihnen Laura Meier 😘 How many Indian's are learning German here  ? Hallo! Ich heiße Gabriel! Schön, dich kennenzulernen! As a dutch person this is much easier than for english speakers because, quite a lot of words are similar For the German speaking people, I have a question for you all:

Okay, so, I live in South Africa, born and raised here and my first language is Afrikaans, which is derived from Dutch. But I also believe we have some strong German roots. My last name is Hagen, is that a German last name? 

My father is from Namibia, where there is still a lot of German speaking people so he grew up hearing the language a lot and has always wanted to learn it. So I'm trying to learn German with him because it has always been one of his wishes and I just like learning new languages. 😊 Hallo.Ich hieß John WICK. After watching this video, my listening skills have improved, English listening skills of course Laura : in the last lesson,we talked about numbers,have you forgotten?

Me : But it was just 1 second ago,how could I forgot it. Danke Bin ich wirklich die einzige Deutsche die sich das anguckt? 😂 im from malaysia but in my schook we have german class Me:
Opens YouTube to learn Spanish prepositions.

2 seconds later:
Sit to watch this entire 25 min video for no reason My brain now 1.46am Thursday 8 July 2021 decided to wanna learn German. I wanna learn German cuz I wanna move there one day Quick Tip: Use an anaesthetic on your tongue before learning. German Tutor: It's very easy.
*Starts with the whole dictionary in first sentence.
How can I untwist my tongue? Can someone answer me? When i say “My German is not very good”, would i use Mein or Meine? Anyone can learn a new language or two but they don't want to put the work. I've been learning German with my daughter for a bit now, we try to communicate in German sometimes and it's been helpful. Im learning English also from you .. thanks alot..so much അമ്മച്ചി സൂപ്പർ Ein bischen (a little) almost sounds like I’m bitching!

Bye 



Did she actually want to say that ?    
I can't understand I think she's so beautiful. German is hard for me i'm from india I know English

How don't you like it? it's going well so far  :) dont lie, you too are here to invade the reddit comment section. 25 minutes to learn a 3 minute thing? piss off lmao x'D Totally not here in order to read mein kampf I was so surprised I could learn so fast just in 25 mins German . Marketing is excellent skill . 😅 Now I'mma learn Germany language after her introduction, well nevermind skip to the next language 🤣🤣 I have a German cousin. Next time I see her she won’t know what hit her when her cousin that can barely English begins to German hehe. I really want to learn more than two languages so this is an exciting and very informative video to get me started on German:)) I learned a lot of words in just 2 days 😂 Yes me learning 🇩🇪 from 🇮🇳 because germany is my fav football team . Laura has crazy eyes. My name is Fatima, when she started calling Fatty are you ready, i was like o.o I was watching it for fun.

Great content. Thank you for putting the effort into creating this. Had a quick question - will the A1 & A2 playlists enable me to take the official A1 & A2 German proficiency test? This Video Is Really Good Thanks a lot, it was quite useful. Personally, I always give a firm handshake and like eye contact, but that's good to know, culturally. As it is, I can't stand 'jello' handshakes - they're horrendous 😆 I'm sure lessons are great but you said free worksheets, there is only 1 free worksheet as far as I can see The Alive Version Of Duolingo I want to learn german.  Just because i think it will make me sound sexxyy Mam, What about good afternoon? 1:35 Alan from hangover 😂😂😂 Nice 7:56 ⏩ danke Nice Danke!

🤩🤩🤩 🥳🥳🥳 Hi Anja this is the best German learning channel I have ever seen , thanks a lot keep your awesome way and reach for the stars ,ich liebe dich 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 Hallo ich bin Khaled und ich komme aus syrin Vielen Danke !! From Brasil . danke schon fur deine  Video Ich liebe  dich  anja Thank you Anja! "Guten Morgen" Ich bin Sadia und ich komme aus Bangladesch 🇧🇩 und Ich bin 13 Jahre alt und ich wohne in Hamm mit meine Familie.I was everyday looked yours videos now I can speak little big Deutsch. I saw German lesson 1 Until 30 and now I saw that and now  I wrote that what learnt .and  Thank you Anja. Dankeschön. Los Geht's Merhaba :D Was man schreibt, bleibt. Gute Nacht! Schlaf schon! Hey Anja i am Dutch (the swamp Germans) and I think your videos are really good. I have a problem and I hope you can help me. Dutch and German share both very similar words and words that are very different eg aufgabe= opdracht, gutenmorgen =goedemorgen, you get the point but also a lot of words that share no similarity now my problem is that whenever I do a German exam for my university I can get very unsure whether it is one or the other. This means that me and a lot of other dutchies germanify Dutch words on tests (which is just wrong) eg we would say bettrief (germanification of the Dutch word bedrijf) instead of unternehmen or konzern do you have any tips or other things to help me with this problem? Thanks! My grandpa’s grandparents were from Germany, Stuttgart in fact. The language in our family ended with them. I want to learn, I just don’t have the motivation toearn. Thank you so much for the homework and extra activities You are so sweet and thank you Thank you so much for being my first German teacher. Because of you I started learning German 🥰🥰 ich liebe und schätze dich sehr, Anja! Du bist so eine nette Person. Alles, was du machst, ist wunderbar Thank you very much ! Very motivated to learn German ! Wow sub Thai🙏♥️🌹🌹 Thanks 🌹 Bless you Anja!!❤️ Ich kann noch so viel von dir lernen. Ich höre immer wieder, wie viele mit deiner Hilfe deutsch lernen. Das ist echt toll. Hallo Ich Bin Bryce. I'm an American living in Wyandotte Kansas. pretty much everyone here only speaks English 97% Percent of the time. I Hate Conflict I really do!! Last Month I went Shopping at Wal-Mart. An Employee Almost Kicked me out for Not wearing a Mask. But I was speaking German to her and Pretending I don't Understand English to Avoid Conflict.
it was like this.

Employee: Do You Have A Mask?
Me: Was Hast Du Gesagt?
Employee: I'm Sorry what?
Me: Was Hast Du Gesagt?
SILENCE followed by me walking Away!!
it's sounds like something that would happen in a comedy Movie But I'm not making this Up!! this seriously did happen. Hallo und Gute Nacht لغتك العربية جيدة جدا 😊

Das Video ist sehr Tutorial danke <3
Video very tutorial thanks <3 nice Danke DANKE! looove youre channel! ❤️🇩🇪 Please turn off that background Musik. the rest is great. 3 i 3eè  v  sjstyshryhrfgby35qhwsbfsrth I like Danke ❗️it was such a great video I'm 68, and have been learning basic German. Danke. You sound very Albanian ..where are you from ? Thank you! I'm learning German in school and we have a test coming up so this really helps! at 0:13 its music from mm2 from roblox Taken german course , still trying to remember numbers in german İ HAVE  a german quiz on this:( but its okay because  i worked this altime. :) Danke I have noticed Eins (1) thing: the pronounciation of sechs (6) does not sound too appropriate if you think about it... hmmmmmmmm... 4:53 Imagine if someone actually called this number. If you did, then what happened? I hope, Learn German, that you didn't actually make us listen to your number.

When I tried to say Funfzehn (15) It did NOT end well. I ended up babbling things like Fuznfenz and Funfazehn and Funfzfne (whatever that is). It took A LOT of tries and a long time of laughing at the noises I made to finally get there. Thankfully, all the rest were fairly easy and Elf (11) has the same pronounciation as the English word for elf - there's a hint for you guys. OOF, I still can't say Funfzehn right. Never give up until you do it right, though. Viel Danke!!💙💙 quarantine brings me here :))) the medic likes this video So nice explanation thanks for this video 😊 i cant pronouce drei  correctly please help Vielen Dank ;) yep learn German in an Indian accent. eins zwei polizei drie vir grenadier funf sechs altihex sieben acht gooten acht ❤️❤️❤️ Why there is a music in background thank you so much love your way I love the way you teach, superr Wow, this is very helpful for me n my best friend.

Sounds like learning a language in a  club😱😤 بصراحه  حلو والله  انا فى اوله  ثانوى وكنت بحفظ الارقام 😂😂😂😂🤭 Thank you for Sharing maybe it would be easier to listen without the music??? I have a question! 
Does some of the "R" that you pronounced, sound a bit like the english ones, that's how it is or is something personal? Please don't keep the background music . It doesn't help to focus instead it takes away our attention .No Offense. Vielen Dank! 🔥🔥❤️❤️😀😀 Ich bin ein über poliglote meine materfikeren xDDD nah but I'm playing a game where all the voices are in german and can only understand half of what they say, need to study more hehe danke!!!!!!!!!

Thank you for this I am now subscribed. Muchas gracias! Excelente clase Ich komme aus Thailand.
Wunderbar. Danke schön. This is saurabh from India. I am also learning German but it is difficult to learn without practice. I am sharing my contacts number to talk in German.  If anyone interested please ping me on 7845718662 or send message on WhatsApp. 
Thanks, Thank you for your patience, and dedication to explain each part of the sentence, the correct exact pronunciation and the IPA! thank you for your help,  you are helping so much.. I'll keep learning and more practcing....!!! Thanks for a Upload....http://3peartechnologies.com/ you are so cute. thanks oh mum you are the best I love your teaching and pronunciation, 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 you're the best Ausgezeichnet! an outstanding tutorial - you just can't beat seeing and hearing the spoken German. Text books take you so far but for conversation (which most will be interested in rather than reading German newspapers) seeing, hearing and speaking German is absolutely essential. Very good teach . Thank you for the lesson . I wish she was still making videos. It’s a shame I found this so late. I would pay her to teach me. She is by far the best teacher on YouTube and I’ve seen quite a few. So calm clear and concise explanations in detail. Danke  für der sehr gut Deutsch Lessons 💖 du bist ein engel :) thanks teacher! Amusing Really interesting technique, thank you Would like to get in contact with somone who wants to practice german. I live in Venezuela, so we could get in contact by FB, please let me know: joset4359gmail.com or writing a sms to +584165373344, my native language is spanish, but I also can understand a few words in english... Super Fielen dank mom I need your number danke I prefer not to waste my time learning how to read phonetic script. If I was going to spend that much time I would rather just learn how to read in German. Why would a normal person want to pronounce so well, but still remain illiterate? Who does that impress? You are amazing...thanks for the video

Can you send me a link where i can download your full tutorial of the German course....say a dvd compilation o the courses. downloading for offline practice nice video madam....expecting more such videos.."DANKE" or suggest me a teacher who teach like you madam i want your classes online please smilethe294@gmail.com it is great , just great .thanks a lot I really appreciate the detailed pronunciation guide to make sure that my accent doesn't sound like a spitting contest. I think it would be really helpful if you had a small recap at the end where you repeat the conversation over and over again, that way we really get it in our ears and have time to try and anticipate it! Either way, I'm really glad I found this and will be perusing more! Danke! guten guten guten guten guten guten guten guten guten guten guten guten guten TAAAAAAAAAAG Is it accurate to say that "Vorsicht is to Sorgfalt what (being) careful is to caution?"
11.05.17 This is an excellent video. Very good teaching techniques. You have changed my mind. Initially i thought German is a difficult language. Excellent and thank you. That's the problem with most school courses they concentrate on rolling r and writing correctly. None of that is really very useful you really need to know how to hold up a conversation not that worthless nonsense My only how is your writing and speaking kids braided into two videos most people don't care about us proper way to write Best German tutorialist What a great teacher!  concise and clear pronunciation and grammar details. Thank you danke.. She's pretty thank you for sharing this video! I really enjoy the fact that you go over each sound. It gives me a chance to practice it, until I feel almost secure in my pronounciation. This is fantastic! beautiful your videos are very useful. thank you There are several components to teaching yourself to understand German easily .

Mein gott Alisa ist sehr hubsch, ich bin echt verliebt I shouldn't have stopped studying German. Great video! And cool teacher. ❤️ I wish my real German teacher was as fun as Alisa Alisa makes learning fun and easy! I usually dont watch these videos because I thing they`re boring but not in this case! Keep doing what you`re doing! She is way too cute!!!! I which If my German teacher was like you Omg !!

Wauuu wauuu... i drop dead gorgeus.. you are so much beautyfull ...grettings from chile .....rica rica rica estas hecha de chocolate ... jajajja slds desde chile i literally said hallo back like she said hallo lol YOU SHOULD REPEAT AT LEAST TWICE THE PRONUNCIATION BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY SENTENCE CAUSE BEGINNERS CAN GET CONFUSE. kböu 10:47 8:38 I now understand what hilfe meant in Wolf of Wall street at the airplane scene. I though it was a name. Danke Schon ^^ Am I the only one that finds it very hard to focus when she smiles :))))) I'm sorry but i have to question this.

Allisa you are such a good and cute teacher. Me looking at Alisa making a video: "I'll have some of what she's having..." “Mom I finally fell in love with a girl”
“Oh that’s so nice honey when am I gonna meet her?”

Ich habe zwei online Freunde aus Deutschland, auch mir hilfe Sie geben.  Es ist einfach nicht, aber klein von klein, Ich lerne Mehr.  Given your seemed liking of tongue twisters, I'm awaiting the tale of 11 elves who ride elephants helping the 12 wolves of Wolfsburg who want wool. mwahahahaha!!  But seriously, anybody unsure about watching the 3 hrs, it's well worth it.  Nur Sie machen es! For surei love this so much thanks its doing a great job in my life thanks. Easy to understand and u are blessed to be e great teacher 1:04:43 lol Danke Herr!!! 01:43:17 It is "Das" and not "Der" Opfer. Having said this, in the beginning you say that learning the Alphabet is useless and then you go ahead and go over each letter, which is basically the same thing as learning the alphabet. Or is it not. I am teaching some people German and I find it super useful for them to actually know how each letter is pronounced. Afterall, isn't Germany spoken phonetically the whole time!? This is Fun! Danke Best video to leanr german Thank youuu! I will follow your channel l loved it ! DANKE ❤️ You're the best bewinner in german thank you sir so much for this video. it was utterly helpfull. but i have a question to ask. i have 12 months from now before starting studienkolleg and i finished A1 german in 2 weeks (intensive learning). and im aiming to reach C1 in 12 months. do you think its possibe? if so how many hrs you think is needed to study a day? thanks in advance As a German watching this out of interest and boredom I can say:
Best video to learn German EVER. 99.99% correct and to the point. This video alone could save you 3 months of learning.
Advise: do not overly focus on the letter R thing. We don't care ;-) We go mad if you say Porschee lol Sie sind sehr super Yes,you are handsome thanks I've been learning German for 2 years and no one told me any of this! Thank you so much! I find this a very strange way to learn German. Without so much as mentioning the three genders "der", "die" and "das" or the cases nominative, accusative, genitive and dative, or the many other essentials for learning the language correctly such as the conjugation of verbs, you are making a big deal out of short and long vowels. What is more, you suggest ignoring the alphabet. For me, that means that people learning German in this way will never be able to write or speak German properly because they haven't learnt the basic (and very complicated) grammar. If you don't know how to pronounce "ä", "o", "ü" and "ß" or the other basics above you will just sound like a foreigner struggling with a language they haven't learnt properly, and if you don't know the difference between "der alte Mann", ""den alten Mann", "des alten Mannes" and "dem alten Mann" you are doing no more than learning enough of the language to order a beer and a sandwich in Germany, and since most Germans speak English you will almost certainly find them helping you by simply talking English to you. Thank you very much for this informative lesson. God Bless you! Just curious about if I can go for A1 exam after watching this video for A1?.. does this video cover all things that i need to know at A1 level and they are going to ask at the exam !!! ( I'm learning A1 lvl with the help of this video ) lol Vielen Danke ! Amazing can you tell me is it equivalent to A1 and A2 combined? You are the best teacher that teaches us German 👌🤎 Your English is great as a native i hope i can one day speak German fluent thank you for your efforts it was great video Thanks for this amazing teaching Love.

I'm never going to be a blue collar worker. I'm way too good for that. Small mistake at 28:15 "das Schlaf-sheep must be "das Schaf" der Schlaf would be the sleep.
edit: "Der potsdamer Postkutscher, putzt den potsdamer Postkutschkasten." Herr Antrim! Ich habe vier jähren Deutsch auf Hoch Schule gerlernen, und zwei jähren Deutsch auf Universität gestudieren. Das war vor vielen Jahren. As my birthday resolution, I've decided to dust off my German (as my grammar/vocab might show) and I feel the same excitement learning from you as I did when I first started in 1973. Danke! he said ramstein instead of any other city Bravo, Mr. Antrim, Sie sind ein guter Lehrer. I can't thank you enough for making this amazing video sir ! from the order of the lessons to the examples and those skits !

ü: try to speak an उ and form your lips if you are speaking an इ. 
Its sounds similar to an इ and it is difficult to explain, because in English and Indian languages this vocal don't exist.
In the Turks and Chinese language it exists: Atatürk, or Chinese nü   女 . 
ö is al little similar like the i in English "sir". 
ä ist like the a in English "bad" or in Hindi  है! 
Ich bin Deutscher, jedoch besitze ich Kenntnisse in Sanskrit! (I am German and have some knowledge about संस्कृतम् ) Hello mam main german classes lgana chahti hun pls tell me online classes kaise lag a sakte hain Sanskrit is not Mother of German. German has its origin in Germanic sub family. Ancestor of Germanic sub family is sister to old Latin. Old Latin and Greek, old Lithuanian are all sister languages.  These languages had a precursor which is now extinct. That precursor language is sister to old avestan and Sanskrit.
Also Sanskrit is not mother of 'all' languages. Sanskrit is mother of North Indian languages. बहुत शानदार

I would really like to attend a university in Germany, unfortunately I've just started learning the language and I was wondering if I would be able to follow the courses with just 1 year of time to learn German, should I follow my dream or would it be better to not waste time? Danke schön ❤️🙏 Wow just great taughtWould love to hear the German Version of the NATO phonetic alphabet That's cool! The pronunciation looks like some brazilian portuguese words, that's great! 😍 Did you pronounce Z as "ontset" shouldn't it be "tset"? I miss Germany 🇩🇪 now Friedberg for life! 😂 ich danke dir too fast caralho Why so fast? My student can't follow. I can't stand this video! 😡 0:42 DER UMLAUTEN Does Germans put their Alphabet in a different formation because the ß, Ü, Ä, and Ö? Hallo Dominik! Danke for this video :) The umlaut letters are so hard to pronounce, gotta keep trying! Dude at least give some notes that we can follow along you’re making this too fast and it’s a little complicated because of that I love german language. Just a bit different from the Swedish. Danke schön please give alphabet chart with pronunciation of each alphabet  cuz u were  fast  in this video, ie you should have paused in between. This gay ass don't look good MY FIRST IMPRESSION IS GERMAN IS A BORING LANGUAGE. Danke!!! What is the difference between E and I?? sounds same!! Tnx GuP der Film xD Schöner Lehrer E and I are the same? Omg this lesson is exactly what I need as a beginner ! Great lesson . Thank you Dominik:) lego DEEZ NUTZ Hi, can someone recommend me music in german, please? Nice! What program do you use to create such beautiful videos? I'm so glad you made this and put together this playlist! <3 I just discovered your channel. Love the videos and quality instruction! Is there anywhere I can check German movies with English or German subtitles? my name is Kristin 

kah..err..ee..ess...teh...ee..enn My name has a Y in it. UPSILON! Very close to French alphabet! Wast the time for the vocab to get by the alphabet, Man ! How to spell S A NJ A, my name? S A N Y A? it's very easy danke Hey! Awesome lesson! But I still have a question. I'm Alicia. How do I know if German spelling of my name Alicia or Alisia. Sorry if I made mistakes, English isn't my first language. You you just call us pig dog? Swine hunt Off topic, but I like how you displayed your mini figs. Very organized! THOMAS the music in the backgroud made it hard to hear Got bored of just knowing English and Spanish so german is my choice for a third language its so awesome Yeti = abominable snowman 1:59 Das ist ein scharfes S >_> Great video. How would you describe your accent? I've been using the Duolingo app and they never covered the alphabet or numbers. It's a very robotic voice but paired with your video I can make it work. I really need this lessons thank you so much ♥️♥️♥️ I am new in this language and your video help me a lot...............Thanks If you really want to learn German I found a really good program. Try it out...

http://bit.ly/2BBWPGI

I love it! Could you explain the difference in how to pronounce E and I. They sound the same to me. Knowing the article for each noun might seem daunting but it eventually comes intuitively from hearing a word used with it's article enough times. Das Haus just sounds right and die Haus sounds wrong to me. If you don't know the article, have a stab at what sounds the most right to you and you'll be correct slightly more times than chance would permit. 

P.S Abstract nouns tend to be feminine. Thanks Dominik~! I am Korean, I will conquer German by following you~! Thank you so much! يلي عرب هون يحطو لايك The "y" messes me up cause it's just so random like "ex" then it just goes "Yepsilon" (?) like wtfffffff y is very easy to remember, but the rest is confusing. I gotta practice! It is Chemie* and not Schemie! very fast 😆 Haben Sie vielleicht die gleiche Videos aber ohne Verschnitte? Ich bin Deutschlehrerin in der amerikanische High School und wuerde sehr gerne diese Videos in meinen Kursen benutzen aber es gibt manchmal schlechte Woerter.... Solche Videos darf man in die amerikanische Schule nicht nutzen. :( While I was on an Indian Airplane , I had to  watch SMS FUR DICH Aaaaaaand subscribed. Danke 😁 When he said German songs/music who else thought of Rammstein so e and I are pronounced the same? Some sounds are only found in German Hey Dominik,  What is the name of this music => 4:42 ? I feel like Liesel here do you teach German online? Well, in English the only "the" is "ze." Ze apple, ze house, and ze chemistry. is there a specific format for speaking German, like for Afrikaans you would use Subject Verb1 Time Object Manner Place Verb2 Infinitive. Ich bin in German für ich hahaha :D merci beaucoup dominique i cant find the B looking thing on the german key board on mobile hey ,if anyone else trying to find out learn German pdf english try Corbandy Learn German  Crusher ( search on google ) ? Ive heard some extraordinary things about it and my neighbor got amazing results with it. There are some parts of the German Alphabet that  are pretty similar to the Spanish one. Are you studying to become an actual teacher, or something along those lines, bro? I saw that japanese poster behind you ;) gut i am stell at the first lesson i will work so heart couse i will visit germany soon so i wanted to learn it very soon and i know you are the solution oh so amazing i am really excited to learn this cute language
 i hope you can help me There are only 26 letters in the German alphabet. The additional symbols are actually diacritics, not letters. This is according to Oxford and I have emailed you the pictures as proof, Dominik. Great video 😁 in my quest to learn German wer spricht hier alles deutsch oder bin ich die einzige die das guckt? There is no better time to make this video than on the 1st of September. aa b c d e f ghee ha e yocht ka l m n uu p quu aer es t uu faus vee ikxs opselon onset.... :) This video is not helpful for a beginner. OH, Please slowly and repeat every alphabet many time, i can not concentrate..... i am going to see another lesson::SORRY the alphabet is so similar to Portuguese. I'm thinking that will be easier to learn German  than English to me. you looks like Hawkeye this time 😂 nice its pretty confusing sometimes.. there are like a combination of English and Indonesian alphabets in my mind.. and the german is the mixture of both language alphabets das language hard My name is now pronounced "Coolen" sandra thank you so much!!! it helpes a lot Lol the german alphabet sounds like the Spanish, english and french alphabet combined, also a little bit of greek alphabet. I think he made a mistake. The name of ß is scharfes S (German) but he gave Eszett (Austrian) i enjoyed the video, but was confused by 'Z'.  In your pronunciation, it sounded like you said "und z".  If you are not familiar with German, would you think the "und" is part of the letter? or just "and z". JÄGERRR!!!



I'm sorry but I watch an anime called Attack on titan and a guy's name is 'Eren Jäger'. In the theme song there is a moment where he is shouting (the singer) 'JÄGERRRR' sorry I just thought  I let you know.



Sorry I'll stop.


I love German thx this helps with german class.😜 Mostly similar to Indonesian alphabets pronunciation Wait, Can't you tell the der, die, and das apart. I thought that der was masculine, die was feminine, and das was neutered. So as long as you know the if it is a masculine or feminine you can know if it is der, or die. Then if it is not either of those it would be das.She Sounds like she’s trying to brainwash us.

and Sind Sie sicher? Having a conversation, or "unterhalte," means to "under hold" someone. Yeah, it has always felt like someone was holding me underwater whenever we were having super long discussions! I like that you use the same coordinating conjunction (weil) for every sentence. It's such a huge word, and repeating it 50+ times really makes it sink in. Thank you very much for your hard work and for your positive energy. I love your videos. Thank you. So amazing!!!

Best regards,
<3 Hallo Jenny!  17:39 Was mochten Sie drinken? Not trinken? Danke These great, I'm sure it's wright way of learning, starting from the top. More narrow list below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpCd40ntEfM Love your channel! You're doing an amazing work! Haben sie viel geleistet . Danke . Wann Kommt ihr?  ( When are you guys coming)  NEIN  NEIN NO  ( When are you all coming) Das is richtig . Guys in the USA means males and males only. I'm sorry, but I have a question. Why is it that sometimes you put the verb in the end of the subordinate conjunction sentence, and sometimes you keep it in a normal order? Is it something that will be explained in a future video?This is super helpful! Thank you so much, but I have one question, what does informal and formal mean? ICH liebe es Es ist schon An hour?  ...it's 1 hour 14 seconds. If your going to teach German, you need to be precise! 🧐 🤣 I don't think it's a good idea to show the words as they are pronounced. Seeing the words written down destroys the pronunciation. I love this German-learning video so much !!! 1 hour/day for 7 days ❤️❤️❤️ Wie geht es „Ihnen“? I speak English and French, but I never considered learning German until now. Thank you for this. Natürlich= naturally= course🍃 Me:

We can learn in the phone... Thank you so much! Its really helpful specially for us who's having trouble to learn deutsch. Just subscribed in your channel Danke sehr! This video is totally helpful ! Vielen Danke! ! But I have a question that how to keep up with the vocabulary till here and even at further levels? Sometimes I get jumbled up with words. Können Sie bitte mir  mit dieses probleme helfen? Bien présenté, merci, Danke Really good. I am learning such a lot. Love the voices and presentation. Will continue and next time hope to answer in Deutsch! Superb, thanka a bunch...I am.learning German now why?  Well....English is useful BUT not enough and has a very limited shelve life communication wise if you speak it i a country that do not speak it as a first or second official language. Each language does open commercial/cultural/work/folkloric/artisanal doors that others cannot! Also, as much as I like to use English of course being in the UK now or speaking it to folks that has it as a first language, I am noticing tough and can see as my predictions which  usually becomes true in such matters, that more and more people have started since 2018-2019 not to choose English as a second language as a reflex to use it like the Lingua Franca right away but go for French, Spanish, Russian, German, Malay etc...which are per regions of the globe and for some, internationally, lingua francas themselves. 

Some folks also seem to go for specialized languages like Icelandic or Maltese or Farsi to open special historical and cultural doors ...

Since Brexit (which I understand the reason for) and so many Trumpist extremists in the United States being there still, English will be used less around the world, at least and indelibly at less than 15%, by 2023-25.

I speak French, English / American, Mexican Spanish and I now go all the way for the first language in the continent of the European Union and in many German diasporas around the world and in the countries that speak it officially or as a second language in some regions: German!

Ich spreche Französisch, Englisch / Amerikanisch, Mexikanisches Spanisch und strebe jetzt die erste Sprache auf dem Kontinent der Europäischen Union und in vielen deutschen Diasporas auf der ganzen Welt sowie in den Ländern an, in denen sie offiziell oder als Zweitsprache gesprochen wird Einige Regionen: Deutsch ➡️SEX WITH ME IN MY LINK

THANKS A LOT https://youtu.be/DR-ZgeS3DZg ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Nice  . Easy and simple .  Love From Punjab ☬ Your previous video was amazing ma'am. 
Among some my fav teacher now you are also one of. Thanks a lot teacher Sunny. Your lessons are very much systematic and helps me a lot. Have a nice day! Thank you your teaching is really good thanks ❤️ you eased my way to learn German thanks a million Awesome vid, thanks You are an awesome teacher 😊 Danke, Sunny. Guten Tag! Thanks for this video! It's amazing! 😃 what about the case when 'ch' is right after o-umlaut? like in the word 'möchte'. How does 'ch' sound like? I love it! thanks Hello. I am doing this course along with the app Duolingo, and I’m confused on “sie” being “you”. I thought it was “du” and “sie” is “she”
Obviously I don’t know German, but asking this as a clarification.  Thank you very much! Are you native speaker German or English? I’m German and you pronounce it that good that I can’t tell whether you’re German or not. And you often say „In German we say...“. But I’m not quite sure if you’re native speaker in German. When she pronounced Orange I couldn't stop but burst into laughter..😂

Great channel though A lot of love to you from Morocco ❤🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 thank you sunny, you are great <3 Brilliant. The best way to begin learning a language ! way to go! Danke 🙏 Wow So good for beginners the best video for german beginners. awesome thanks sunny su Your video is so nice. I want to love learn german language hope your teaching support me my goal. Thank you so much and keep on.... TY Thank you. This is even better than my A1.1 class ❤️❤️ I can't pronounce sprechen TT it's so hard for me when it comes to the 'r' part Thanks  alot 🙂🌹 Ich mag viele! the best lesson i have ever had thank yo so much im motivated to learn dutch more gathered many  vocabulary here. thank you Indeed. Best of all This is the only one I found simple enough for beginners. Grazie mille Really helpfulllll, thank you so much thanks!... sie means you? I thought it means she Someone from india You are the best Sunny keep going 👍👍👍 It's pronunciation why we dont write ai (egg) in place of ei when somone kick u in ur stomach 0:56 Danke Sunny su ma'am its OIROPA Some things are missing, in my opinion.
Lesson 1: ß + ss. vocals before that are either pronounced short (Fass, Schuss) or long (Fuß).
Lesson 2: ck. Vocals before that are usually pronounced short (Zucker, Bäcker).

Didn't get far enough but another thing is: vocals before a double letter are pronounced short: "Letter", "Lappen", "Ziffer". That's the reason why the sentence "Was labbersch du!?" displays great moronity. :3 Hmm

God teaching







😂😂 Vielen vielen Dank mam. Ich finde dies Video sehr nützlich für mich, mein Aussprache zu verbessern. 🙏 Thank you so much 💕 These people just put up so many adds ❤️    ❤️    ❤️ Very beautiful presentation and I really love how she repeats each sound/words twice so we understand them clearly.

Good lam from egypt  and l following you gud gud gud video maam maam maam mmaam maam a having a Scottish accent really helps with the umlautes. Ä sounds like Ayr, a town. ö sounds like Oor a slang word for Our. Ü sound like the ool in school. "sie" is not 'you'. It is she. For 'you' we have a word "du" You have a wonderful voice! So clear and understandable. I also wonder where you are from. It seems you are a polyglot :D 
You should continue to do more german videos, very good work! I'm too broke to buy a book or pay for a lesson to learn. Thank goodness I found your channel! Awesome lesson, you are the best teacher. Im learning german for my german guy.

Your youtube channel is so underrated to be fair! very dificult super helpful course for beginners!! thank u so much for those amazing videos <3 That's so hard Omg!u r amaaaaazing♥️♥️
What an easy way🤍
U are my starting point for learning German♥️🔥 but "sie" doesn't mean "you"... it means "she" and "Sie" means they! Plzz some one explain me about "ch''  2 case... Like how is she pronouncing it... your are the best believe me , Danke xoxo Thank you for the lesson, it helps me a lot Im curios, how does a1 to b2 exam  look like.. Is it multiple choice or what? I lost it in the grouped cnsntd.. "Ch" wtf???? You are doing amazing thank you.
That's very helpful Very very nice mem Thanks, very good.. you inspired me.. Good materials to go through Deutsch L. Great! Good Luck! Im sure shes a great teacher! You made a mistake sie is she How come sprechen's 'ch' has the throated 'ch' sound. In the consonant pair section, it said that it only had the throated 'ch' sound if this came after an: a, o, u, and au? thanks :)I hope you enjoyed this video 😁Get my new German training with free lessons and learn more about my German Academy here 👉https://learngermanwithanja.com/free-training Thanks Anya Hallo!

Danke schon, Anja.It is very helpful and easy to understand .. Vielen danke.. Wunderbar du bist nett Certainly helpful for a beginner, although the speaker is not a native and has an accent in her German (possibly Indian?). Nani Dankeschön für das Video Danke👍🌼 What does "gern" and "sich " "noch" mean ? 
+ Is hätte a conjugation from haben ? I've been listening to german songs to help me learn Deutsch but I found that she pronounces word in different ways than of yours Is this because of different accents or what ? Please answer Guten Tag. Ich habe einen Tisch fur vier Personnen reserviert. Ich hatte gern einen frisch Saft und vegetarisch Hamburger und ich zahle mit bar. Vielen Danke! Sind Sie Deutsch-Muttersprachler? Ich finde Ihre Aussprache ein bisschen dialektisch. Woher kommen Sie? 3.22 und 3.14 Vielen Dank für diese toll Videos! Bestellen

Wir wollen einen tisch fur 2 personen
Haben sie reserviert?
Ja, auf den namen muller
Nein wir haben nicht reserviert.. I love you clharen 4.39 Ich mochte haben mein richte Hand zuruck, bitte! Im sitting here wondering why the bad pronunciation and why so sloooooooooooooooooow. we're beginners at the language but we get how to press puse to read below. Isn't Kaffee masculine? Then why is it einen? We use einen in akkusative in the case of der. Can someone explain me? This is a fantastic program I’m learning very fast from this program ,danke . 8:36  Why is it "Wir möchten zahlen bitte" and not "Wir möchten bitte zahlen" how can i follow the new lessons along with the new words or the german language dictionary with english translation, can you send me a list of lessons, thank you.

￼ Vielen dank 🌺🌺🌺 Hi,  how do I translate the following sentance into german: the services were excellent and the staff is skilled and hospitable? Thanks a lot. Hi, how do I translate the following sentance? The services were excellent and the staff is skilled and  hospitable. Thanks where is worksheets ? Vielen dank! 3.09  Nein, wir haben nicht reserviert.   Shouldn't it be 'reservieren' as the pronoun is 'wir'? Danke, Ich liebe ihre videos. There’s a lot to absorb in this lesson. I have a question though, can we say either “ich möchte...“ or “ich möchte gern“? Vielen Dank 🙏🏼 👍 When the guest is saying that they would like to pay, he says: "Wir möchten zahlen bitte" 
However, I thought the Hauptverb was always on the end, so shouldn't this instead be: "Wir möchten bitte zahlen"? 
Or can bitte go in either place? Danka Hier einmal die pizza / hier ist die pizza
What is the difference ? The best Lehrerin in the world😍 Why did we used ein/eine  in the first order and then used der/die in the next one with pizza and salad? Thank you Hello Good Afternoon!
First of all thanks for your time/ help!

In 1:16 der Kellner (Maskulin) / die Kellnerin (Feminin). Here der & die denotes a gender of a sentence.
But in 1:20 der Gast (Singular)/die Gäste (plural). Here der & die denotes Singular and plural form of a sentence.

My doubt is, How to use in which place we can use der/die as a gender & der/die as a singular & plural form in a sentences?

Thanks in Advance! Thank you so much! Danke schön! This is super duper useful! I watched all of your videos already, but I'm just watching it again. I'll will try to do the homework you left us. Thank you! At 5:40 the waiter's plate hasn't even been edited out. Bruh. Danke schön danke ich spreche etwas deutsch Danke schön 😉 das video hilft mir Vielen dank:)

Dankeschön, I'd like to know why my German fiancé uses gern with möchte most of the time. He said there's a difference when you don't use it, but I didn't comprehend what it is.
His sentence was "Möchtest du gerne deutsch lernen?"
Also, he calls Sandwich "abschnitte Fleisch auf Brot." That's what his 100-year-old Opa says too. Very good tutorial, vielen dank! 💚💛❤😍😍 Vielen Danke esto es una pta miercoles your videos are awesome! one question: is there any difference between Wie wollen einen Tisch..

Sie ist eine alberne Katze aber ich liebe sie. Hi , I liked this lesson,  is there more of it? I want more examples or videos about this topic How could an Apple get a masculine article? "Der" Hallo guten Tag Danke schön 🙋‍♂️ Mam you said that every noun has an article with it but at 3:30 when you wrote  "Das ist Peter" there is no article before Peter and it is a proper noun.
Can you clear my doubt please??

Danke !! sabine ist ledig!
ich bin auch ledig （＾ｖ＾） The thumbnail for the video is so stereotypical. I am facing a confusion. I need your help. It might be sound silly. You told that in case of nominative subject, the article with singular form, the article depends upon the gender of the subject. For. e.g. singular masculine form, 'Der' will be used, 'Die' for feminine and 'Das' for neutral. But, How can I, classify an object. Because, I can understand why it is, 'Der Mann, or Die Frau' but why it is 'Die Apfel' not 'Das Apfel'. Similarly, there are many more examples. like, why 'Der Kafer, and Das insekt?'; Why 'Das Pferd , and Der Hund?' Is there any set of rules, based on we can classify the gender? Very good Danke .I learned so much Vielen Dank Danke❤️Ich spreche etwas Deutsch holy shit this is so hard Danke ❤️ Спасибо! 45 vierundfunfzig? Einundzwanzig is it correct .

Danke! im watching this before 1 hours of my exam :") pls help me, is verb conjugations differ by possessive pronouns, 
ex - which is correct "sprichst dein vater english ?" or "spricht dein vater einglisch?" 
As per personal pronouns, dein is for du. so I thought just like "sprichst du" it will be sprichst dein. Gracias!!! Viellen Dank .Das ist sehr hilfreich.Das hilft uns sehr. 1:23, I thought he had a stadium. It's just nice for learning purposes to know you know all possible variations. Why ein come in the sentence of Das ist ein kind.. nd why it is nit come in Das ist julia The best channel ever to learn german. Keep it up. all is clear , however the ES example is Not quite , could you give another example with this ES (its ) please ? 
when you say Das ist sein fernseher - equal to me as that is His tv . please explain bit more . Thx u How will I know when to use dein or ihr ? 
Anyone i don´t understand it but am german . LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL Watching this video one day before exam 😅.. Only legends do this...
Legends give their attendance.. 😆😆 In the comments below. 📗📒🖊️.. I'm waiting.. I really thank you so much for this big effot,, you made it easy to everyone of us and I have a question regarding your pronunciation which is the clear R sound,which part of German pronounces the R sound very clearly like you? Hey @learngerman, I checked on internet, it shows that Akkusative in Neutram possive pronouns ends with S . What is that logic. Du bist meine Beste Lehrerin Dankeschön:)) Please remove the subtitle .. thanks Danke!!! Vielen danke! You are amazing Thank you for the video it is very helpful 🙂🙂🙂 Thank you very much LEARN GERMAN your channel is amazing for German learners Great, thanks a lot Vielen Dankeee!!!!! thanks a lot ! Thank you l got 40/40 in my German paper !!Ear rape warning!! I started to be more curious about german. When you know the rules, it's easier and more convenient for you. Can you please make a video about tips for writing sentences. My main problem is this. I am struggling into applying a proper rule to the sentence. This helped me a lot in my exams 
It helped me to score better than before Vielen Dank für die Lektion omfg there was a chart for this the entire time Your lessons and way of teaching is awesome, thank you. I just have one request that is it possible to not have the background music please? Excellent, lovely and clear Vielen Dank!
Helped a lot. 1:09 Thank you for your great lessons watching this before 2 hours of my exam :D :'D Ich komme aus Eritrea.vielen dank. katze is feminine instead of using Das everytime  we should use Die . i m treally getting confused Your lessons are very easy to follow and I love that the lessons are introduced systematically. I just hope that lessons 17 to 40 something have available transcripts in your patreon. I can only download lessons 1-16 transcripts, then it jumps to lesson 44 worksheet. :( Excellent teaching. Is there any download option for these video lessons? I want to learn offline. Sie is so confusing in german. She, you, they everyone called sie Thank you, I learn many things from your channel. Lovely, just found this.  Excellent, thank you for this. Vielen danke ! An amazing video  keep going 👏🏽 Great explanation as always. However, as you said on the first explanations, these are not possessive pronouns, these are possessive articles. For example, in english, the possessive article for the first person singular is 'my'; 'my car', 'my tv', and so forth. Now, the possessive pronoun for that same person and number would be 'mine', as in 'yes, that car is mine'; and opposed to 'yes, that is me (1sg.obj)'. Then, 'mein', 'dein', 'sein', etc, are not possessive pronouns cause they don't mean 'mine', 'yours', 'his', etc, respectively. They mean 'my', 'your', 'his' (which's form is the same as it's possessive pronoun counterpart 'his'). Just an observation jaja. das ist ein kind; es ist 5 jahre alt?  es - it is 5 years old? aaa amazing  channel learning in school  your  vedio  helping  a  lot thank you you are amazing Possessive artikel is separate from possessive pronomen. This channels videos are amazing😃😃........  I like your videos 😍😍...... You explains very well......😘😘 Thank you for making this video.....🙏🙏 The explanation is amazing. Thank You , this channel really amazing for learning German Danke ! Deine kanal  ist perfekt 👌💫 Not cool at all,soooo boring Ahhhh it’s challenging! Deine Videos sind sehr toll! Entschuldigung bitte..
Where is formal of you... I mean you have explained informal of you(du).. but u have not mentioned formal way.. Thanks for these lessons maam. Just confused about why der being used infront of fernseher? Best In das katze why didn't you put die katze ? Er..
🍞🥐Ist das sein essen
🥾🥾sind das Seine shühe Your thumbs up 👍 is very well deserved 💪 This subtitles cover the Deutsch words 😥😥 Danke meine Lehrerin. Your channel is helping me so much!! Thank you! You're an amazing teacher Wish i can get the best mark for tomorrow exam.
wish me luck baguss Die ist Julia kein das ist Julia that is die Katze you are wrong New to this channel, but I don't understand what some abbreviations are for? Eg. "r Fernseher", "s Auto",  "e Katze", and "e Bucher". what do the r, s,e, and e mean? a typical German kid (5 year old, as shown in this video) has his own TV, Car, Cat, and lots of books.  and When i was 5 getting a lollipop was my  biggest dream You have explained concepts soooo well,concepts that i had been struggling with.ur videos are sehr gut👌👌👌👌 Tugas tugas!!! Wunderbar Video ,Danke Schön 😄🇩🇪👏💯👍☺☺ They are not pronouns, they are adjectives. guten tag fraulein lehrerin, 
was ist dein Geheimnis? so........ if I type something in german do I get that learn german icon between the dislike and the reply button(like if you laugh) The names of the series are all wrong; they are Possessive Adjectives (my/your/his/her/its/our/your/their), NOT Possessive Pronouns (mine/yours/his/hers/its/ours/yours/theirs).The videos are really helpful. Keep making them ! :) Es ist dreizehn Uhr funfzehn. Hello! Thanks for all the videos. It is really really helpful. I have a question if I may ask, here day/days is der Tag/die tag, does it mean that day is considered masculine and others e.g. clock, woche, minute, sekunde are feminine? Thanks for your answer in advance! es ist zwanzig uhr dreig Es ist vierzehn Uhr siebenundvierzig.

To anyone who may be having trouble with learning different languages:

Don't worry. You can do anything as long as you try. It doesn't matter if you're not perfect. Just that you try and don't give up. Giving up means you will never complete your dreams. Giving up means you could lose your opportunity to learn the language (whatever it may be). So keep trying no matter how hard it gets. Keep trying and you can learn or do anything. 
I believe in you! Thank you so much for making all these amazing videos.  They are really very helpful to those who are beginners in their German language learning. 
🙌🙌 Danke!!!

. i have a conundrum and need help.  my friend just had a daughter. he wanted to name her after the river in the netherlands. it pronounced EYE-SELL. two foreign friends of his told him to spell her name AISEL. i looked up the spelling of aisel on google and it gave aisel as meaning two bad words.  i looked up the river and it is named IJSSEL [pronounced eye-sell].  i need to know the english spelling of this river IJSSEL.  or....is IJSSEL the english spelling of this river? i am hoping someone can help me.  he can't keep the spelling AISEL for his daughter if it is a bad word in the dutch language. of course he can't. so please help us if you can.  thank you! Nice job, but sometimes the pronunciation isn't always correct. I'm Dutch and have listened the first few minutes and words like 'vragen', 'familie' should be pronounced as 'vrAgen' (not 'vragEn'), 'famIElie' (not 'fEmilie')... Nonetheless, a great job. hartelijk.bedankt.maar dat.is.makkelijk en.Goed gedaan. Dank u wel meer what language is this? need some hlp plzzzz

I think we have to translate this sentence as 'These are Petra and Jürgen' because this is plural and the word 'sind' means 'are' Danke Should I write it or just see and understand it??
Please answer because I started writing at first but then I saw that there are 62 lessons of A1 which will impossible to write

Will it be correct to say "ich finde das kleid elegant" instead of saying "das kleid ich finde elegant"? 👍 I have one doubt...in the first example of this video,(Sabine hat einen Bruder), how does 'einen' comes before Bruder?

How can I give you thumbs up?!! 😂 why are Indians teaching us German? :P Vielen Dank!💜 Ich habe einen Kuli. 2:36 I was confused as petra liebt “ihren” mann. Why was it “ihren”?

Thanks for all your videos.. one query... You are pronouncing euch like ich... But should not be it pronounced like buch.... As Ch is preceded by u.. please correct me If I'm wrong... Danke At 10.05, spelling of Akkusativ is wrong. Nice video ma'am. danke 30 lessons completed, wow 🤩 👍 Sie ist a good Lehrerin 
Ich finde sie nett Ihre Lektionen sind sehr hilfsbereit , vielen Dank✨🌷 ur videos are stupid
jk 😍😍😍😍 Good evening!
I am finding it very difficult to understand the lesson without the worksheets.
Kindly upload the worksheets for the remaining lessons would be very thankful to you.. 🙏🙏😊😊😊
By the way... Awesome content.. ❤️ Is there any video which explains about difference between akkusativ and nominativ? when you wrote "er ist architekt"
why didn't you write "ein architekt" ?  {4.53} Can someone help in distinguishing between personal pronouns and posseive pronouns in accusative please!? An example would suffice. 👍 Hallo und Freut mich! Ich bin Nia und ich habe eine Frage. i came across the word "Ihnen" that also means "them" just like "sie im Akkusativ". what is the difference? Danke für die Lektion, Frau! "Er ist Architekt" - I wonder why the Germans do not put "ein" before 'architekt', in the same way as in English "He is an architect". Surely both languages, English and German, belong to the same germanic group. 👏👏👏👏👏❤ ich finde dich sehr interssant vielen danke schon 🤗🤗 Ma'am I am learning deutsch now
And I found it difficult but the time I started watching ur video I feel relief that I can learm this language easily

These videos are really helpful. Danke schön Danke At 5:18 it is said "seid ihr glücklich?". Can we also say "bist du glücklich?" Best German learning channel "Du hast"

My mind : dU HAST MICH GEFRAGT verbconjugation (j) is (y) sound thank you that is so nice but i can not fiend part 2 Much helpful videos for learning German. Well structured classes i would Say. Thanks Team Really? In English there are 21 "helping verbs," which our 7th grade English teacher said we had to call them "auxiliary verbs" and we had to memorize every single one of them.
In fact, it's her fault I'm having so much trouble learning German verbs, even in A2.1, because she used to verbally browbeat us every day with "what not to ever do," and every time I do it opposite of the way I was taught (which in German, almost EVERYTHING is opposite the way you do it in English) I hear her yelling in my head about how I'm 'wrong, wrong, wrong" and all the other stuff she said to students who got English wrong. She publicly humiliated them, and embarrassing a 12-year old is way too easy to do. It's stayed with me all this time & I wasn't even the one who was humiliated. I made sure I would never have that happen to me but it made my ability to learn any other language 100 times harder than it needs to be. can u give me any written notes ??
it will help me Sie sehr gut lehreren, danke! (extremely limited knowledge :p sorry) thanks alot Danke I find it so interesting that the helping verbs in German are the same in meaning as Italian. Haben-Avere and Sein-Essere.Hallo! Ich habe eine Frage: 
Why do I hear Deutsch speakers in some videos [not yours] say "Itch" for Ich [like the ch in church] and some say "Ikh" for Ich [like when you say Burke or the german word Buch]? Is this a regional thing? Danke! Bitte schon Omg! You teach so well! Big fan ❤️ Danke, das hat mir sehr geholfen (am I right?) Thank you🌹 Pray for me that i learn German quickly Du bist der beste,danke ! I love your channel! Danke schon 🙂 Why so much fast ... You're an amazing teacher 😍 Your videos are amazing, I am a new learner and your videos helped me a lot ! And one more thing, I noticed that you have replied to each and every comments in the comment box, all doubts or complains, suggestions etc. and that’s what I felt really good about, like many other youtubers don’t reply to the comments : doubts etc. and you are the one I found who really do cares about our comments and you deserve alot! Your explanation n’all are awesome. Keep succeeding!👍🏼, god bless😇. Love from India 💖 Vielen dake Danke I don't understand.. "Ich " is pronounced "Ish" or "Ijj" I HAVE A WEEK WATCHING YOU VUIDEOS AND I HAVE LEARNED A LOT. ich danke Ihnen thanks ❤️ Sehr geherte lehrer und lehrerin,

I know you have already recorded these videos. My recommendation would be to pay more attention and take some time for german pronunciation and if possible  not so much english, feel annoyed with it anf the loudy music, it´s extremely annoying. Danke schon! I've rarely heard someone pronounce "sprechen" with an "S" at the beginning, like "spree".

Danke! Tolles Video bin deutscher wollte mir das mal ankucken wenn jemand meine Sprache lernt ich lerne gerade auch englisch in der Schule. I'm a student of A1. My teacher is a native German. In his class he only speaks in German. This lesson comes in Kapital 9 in Kursbuch. I can not tell you how confused I was in that class as I did not understand a single thing. Now here I am and everything is as clear as water. I just dont know how to thank you guys. Lots of love. danke schon . Background music is so annoying, but the lesson itself is good may I ask.

Merci beaucoup❤️
شكرا جزيلا❤️ Can the las question be formed as -" wir sind ins kino gegangen am freitag" ? Plz help thank you so much!  you are great! The Instructor's German accent is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm still a bit confused. When do I know to use an en or a t at the end of a verb. Like why is it gefahren and not gefahrt? Why is it gemacht and not gemachen? Top lesson,really !!!
I have a question tough ! I don't understand why was "habe" instead of "hat" in some cases ?? like "Ich habe einen Salat gegessen" why not "Ich hat einen Salat gegessen." ??? 
Kindly Please explain. Thank. Very good explanation. The German verb tenses are very similar to Latin. I haven't studied the history of the German Language, but it sees that most of the grammar structure is very similar to Latin, whereas the vocabulary is very different, of course haha This video is of great help to me. I had an assignment in my Deutsche class but I dont know how to find the solution. I read several books, both online and offline, yet no breakthrough. I refused to go to school because I couldn't face my teacher. This video solved the problem for me. "Wir sind letzte Woche nach Paris gefahren" is trasleted as "Last week we travelled to Paris", but it isn't present perfect in English.  Maybe because the time frase "Last week" the English traslation is different. Danke schön by the way, Sie haben eine gute Methodik Danke schön Thanks a lot.. I know I am a bit off-topic here, but please can provide a word by word translation of these sentences,"Sie sieht wie ein römischer Palast aus. Heute ist in ihr aber die Nationalbibliothek." Ich habe nur 3stunden geschlafen. I was absent the day the teacher explained this n here I am on , 😂 tysm for the video 💜 hi Sie hat philosophie studiert??
🤔🤔
Why not gestudiert? And it apply how many verbs? danke <3 In which satuation we use helping verb sein and in which satuation we use helping verb haben... Danke für das Video. Es hilft mir sehr! Ich habe eine Frage. Hier (9:52) kann ich auch sagen,  nur 3 Stunden habe ich geschlafen? Te amo 🔥💕 Danke.🙏🙏 Why do you sometimes use haben and sometimes use hatten? ich habe Nur 3 Uhr geschlafen and du hat deine Hausafgabe gemacht. danke can't find the free worksheets Perfekt in German is a Past tense, not Present tense - unlike Present Perfekt in English Vielen Dank! maam on which vidio you have teach present perfekt? are your vidios of A 1 same as syllabus of goethe institut books or there is any difference ? Can you  please explain again why it is "hat studiert" and we didnt write gestudiert/en or something similar to what we do with others verb? Ich bin von die Niederlande 🙂 it's the same as in dutch Thanks a lot for making this channel. Can we say "Ich habe gegessen einen salat?"Learning German from Afghanistan 🇦🇫
What a great teacher! 😇💚 Im confused at letter W it sounds like letter V in English but in description is way

Mam ur doing a great job. God bless you. I have spent months studying  German quickly and discovered an awesome resource at Landra language tactic (google it if you're interested) Why does the masculine looks like hitler? Thanks your such a good teacher Help me out here:
Ich:SHOULD BE IHAA AND NOT ISH
Says Fau and not ferrrau. 
Machen, do swallowed is wrong
The lack of proper pronunciation in this language is annoying as eff. If Germans themselves can't master it what chance we HAVE? no wonder English is the defacto language for this reason alone and more Germans than ever are speaking eng.

Also die Erklärungen bitte auf Deutsch 😉 sehr gut videos , komm schon danke für das hochladen dieser videos das hat mir sehr geholfen deutsch zu lernen vielen Danke Nice video but can anyone tell me why we used girl with ein How is it "das ist ein mädchen" why it is not "das ist ein mädchen" girl is feminine right How many lessons are there in A1?

Herzlichen dank Ihnen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🌹 Danke .nice video Thank you so much for these.  You're the best teacher!!
But I have a doubt: why is it not "die Mädchen" but "das Mädchen"? Thank you very much for this amazing channel
my question is why its a girl and we said ein not eine? (2:04)
Thank you in advance If you are planning for learning German ,just go through this course and you will learn it !! ""Danke Lehrarin^1m "" 👍 I’m sure this is all very good, but I prefer to listen to a German accent only when I am listening to German.  What is being explained in English is less tiring to listen to if the speaker is English.  Or perhaps the explanation could be in writing and only the actual German spoken.  I think I need to get some books out of the library You are absolutely the best german teacher in the world,vielen dank :))) Vielen Dank 🌷🌷 But what about einen Danke! Can you pls explain why you used das(which is neutral) with girl ( which is feminine) ... 
 Pls clear my doubt!!! You suck Hi girl is feminine why we use ein? Danke schon für diese videos Are there worksheets for this video too? I would like to know... 👍👍👍 Very good videos for learning German. Keep it up!! Why we say Das Madchen tanzt, Its a girl so i thought it should be Die Madchen tanzt. Please clarify Das or Die in this case. Nice  nice i have questions how to understand that tasche (bag) is female 😵😵 Hey, why the word "Mädchen" is with "das" but not with "die". DANKE. MY MAAM NIDHI MAAM SHOW US VIDEO from there das ist ein gut lektion. vielen danke fraulein lehrerin. I love you for what an amazing initiative u have adopted to teach us German for free of cost and help many aspiring Germany-goers to gain confidence. Love from Bangkadesh.

Vielen dank Hii... The use of ein and eine with grocery items is according to english 'a' and 'an' Or is it according to masculine and feminine case.?? Hiiiii boii Danke shön❤️
Thank you very much❤️
Merci beaucoup❤️
شكرا جزيلا❤️ Hallo, I've a doubt on ...
Das ist *EIN* mädchen.
Why "EIN is used on the place of "EINE*...? Bcz. *EINE* is used for femine...! Vielen danke...👍👍 In 3rd example,  where you use Das as definite article for girl. Is it correct? Or it should be die? How can I access to worksheets for every lesson ? i think das ist eine buch beacuse buch is femiline Why there is 'die' and 'eine' for a bag? #doubt 
How come a girl is neutral and not feminine?
Vielen Dank...For your amazing videos..I really liked it very much and have even recommended it to many friends..I now know how to speak German because of you..Really good channel..In no less then a few days I learnt german Why you are pronouncing the r like in English? I never knew I could understand German till I found this channel, i was struggling with this with my teachers!! Thanks Dear you are the best, clean and short!! I had a question about plural indefinite article, I was wondering which one is correct. 1: Das sind Blumen. Or 2: Die sind Blumen? Thank you so much, I study A1 and your videos help me to understand better, danke! Ich bedanke mich bei ihrer Hilfe und ich habe noch eine Frage. Wird das Verb SEIN nur in Nominativ und das Verb HABEN nur in Akkusativ verwendet? Danke! Lehrer! ich spreche etwas deutsch vielen danke!! I can't understand Thanx Okay, I get everything but when it says die Tasche, it puts Das there. So I said Ein but it was Eine. So that basically means I have to know the uhh.. Thing it puts on the front, right?? Danke für die Info und ich habe lernt mich auf den Video! 👍👍👍👍👍 i have a doubt  hope i will get your reply on this ..when you said that ( die Tasche & the sentence was ....Das ist  *eine*  Tasche  but tasche is a thing ya so why neutral article *ein*  was not been used ???????????? How about " einen " ? At 2:30 why is it 'Das' sind Blumen. Shouldn't it be "Die sind Blumen" because Blumen is plural? Deutsch Sprache ist nicht so einfach, aber danke schön für ihre Hilfe 😄 amazing tips to understand unbestimmter and bestimmter artikels Why 'a bag' calls 'eine tasche', instead of 'ein tasche'. Why is cat Eine, how did you know it a female Love your channel 😊 Lesson 19 is not working bitter schon How to you decide useing bestimmt article or untbestimmt article? Danke gut ich liebe ihr Danke schön,jetzt verstehe ich! I paid 2000 Euro for A1 and spend 136 hours of learning and you teach me in 10 min what I struggle to understand in 135 hours. So you can't imagine how much I am thankful to you. Is the teacher from india? Are the lessons numbered? I want to start from the first in order. Your channel is great! Vielen Danke . Ich liebe . Really learn German is very useful for me ... Thank u😊 It's my exam tomorrow there is no way I would pass without this video

Gut Videos Ich bin 900th liker this is the perfect channel if you want to learn german, the lessons are well structured and the teacher is very good
vielen dank lehrerin <3Danke schön. I love this, but next time, can you please talk and type the words in german, (the words your saying) idk why i feel like its easier Leider kann ich kein Deutsch 

Sadly I can't speak German Nice but music is too loud and disturb to learn if i like to be honest sehr gut, ich mag es wirklich. I think this is not for beginners. I can't understand a thing. Love the music! Makes me feel like im in Germany! This was great very good but the music on the backG not needed Die Musik ist zu laut. Ich kann dich nicht hören. Years ago i would not understand the story, now i understand after 160 days streak on duolingo, this makes so happy Danke! Dieses video  ist so gut! I started learning german several months ago and now when I could understood this I was so impressed and so exited thank u very much dino I hop u go on like that I did Duolingo for 4 months and I understood most of this. Vieln dank! This is very helpful! ♥ Ich habe alles verstanden und ich bin glücklich :') i dont know why im here lol 
im german😀 this is really amazing and helpful! liked the video so much :3 Üüüüüüüüü ok alright 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 I.got all of it. ❤️ It was easy German and slow but i got it ! A month on duolingo and I understand most of the words :”””) Thanks for the video. Helps a lot! Does the audiobook have that terrible, and loud, music playing in the background?  I enjoyed reading the book and would love the audiobook.  I just don't understand why they'd have that awful music playing. Diese video ist sehr hilfreich Die Fragen waren eigentlich ziemlich einfach. Ich habe zu erinnere der Text. Ich mag es! Such a shame that awful music is playing in the background, I couldn't clearly listen to the story. Why play music at all when you are teaching a language?? This was aweeesooome!!! At 1:17, when he says "Zuerst muss ich deutsch lernen." Why does he say lernen, instead of lerne? Since the verb for learning, lernen pertains to ich, wouldn't that mean it's in the first person? And thus be lerne? I assume the grammar of the book isn't incorrect, but I am misunderstanding. i just randomly got inspired to speak german and i couldn’t understand much at all. i guess i should go learn the alphabet to begin haha Man, im only halfway through the skill tree on duolingo and i understood 80% of the video! Duolingo ist toll! Toll! 🇺🇸🇩🇪 I'm a beginner in german, I can understand 70% of what he is saying, is it normal to get brain cramps listening to this 🤣 Tach i use duolingo to learn german but i find your video very interesting and simple ,you made it easier for me . awsome video👍 Vielen Dank! Das ist sehr gut. Ich verstehe den ganzen Video! Now THIS is perfect ! Nice but plz remove muisc Guys, I recommend listening to the news in German as well. The news always entails that the newscaster speak clearly and in an articulate manner! I wish I could find more videos like this, does anyone knows some other good YouTube channels or has a playlist? 1.A) 2.B)3.C)4.C)5.B) Great channel.Lucky I found it. I'm sooooooo happy I understood everything.. Thank you <3 I love this series!It's so cute and not difficult for me! I'm on my third day and I haven't a clue what is being said still. Oh my days! Awesome video.  The music is great.  Who is playing and what's the name of the songs?   It seems to be repeating the same song over and  and I can play the chords along with the song on my keyboard.  It's in the key of E major.  Cool!   Wow, I can't get this song out of my head.   The speaking is occasionally a bit distracting.   I'm actually supposed to be learning German, so I need to find a different  video without so much music. Das is sehr gut.. Ich verschtehe das meiste love the background music Ted ist ein Asshole A

Könnten Sie mir bitte erklären, warum es war "Mein Vater spielt nicht Fußball" und nicht "Mein Vater spielt kein Fußball"? Lustig, wohne ich in Neukölln und ich muss auch deutsch lernen! Es ist echt schwer in Berlin zu deutsch lernen. it's very good for learn speak german! ich mag dich clever way to teatch Deutsch! I like it! Hi! Very instructive and helpful video. Is there any chance that you make some more without background music, or at least, with the music more lowered? Thanks! Danke Very useful, i learnt a lot, ty. das hilft mir sehrum meine Deutsch verbessern .Vielen Dank I'm so proud of myself that I could understand this, but it's probably just because he talked slow.  Either way I think these little stories are great for learning. The weather is bad because it rains in Berlin? Try moving to South Dakota in the winter. Right now it's -10.5 degrees Celsius right now. This was great for me. I'm fine speaking in German and writing too, but i struggle a bit with hearing what is being said in German which makes things difficult! This video was a bit of a challenge, but i managed to keep up with understanding everything the first time by listening only! Great practice i think. "kein Job", that part made me remember Brazil...
