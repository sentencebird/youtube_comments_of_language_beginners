Love you 😍
It is really very  very  helpful ☺ cuz hey 2 me  all of us are free to speak whatever language we please  and just cuz  lets say a german couple move to the  u.s.a   they are more than welcome 2 keep speaking their beautiful language if thats wat they want    :) well I'm wanting to acquire the german language just becuz  I too love different languages  and also should i ever meet a german person  that may be home sick 4 their native land  in this case germany i would want to   talk to them not in English  but in their language even if they know english too, i just feel that to me it would show them that i care much about their language to want to start studying it so that they wont feel so  lonely i guess thats what i am meaning. Ich Liebe Deutsch und ich liebe Deutschland auch  :)   yay  hahahaha German alphabet sound almost similiar with Indonesian alphabet sound only far diferent in J V and Y, litle diferent in Q and W sound. But german n Indonesia have realy diferent language The Ü in German sounds like the letter Y in Finnish. That's why it's easy for me to say that letter since i'm also learning Finnish. Thank you❤ The only reason,im learning german is,because, 
YOU UTTTERRRRR FOOOL GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! Danke! Teacher i really Apriciate your lesson (*´▽｀)ﾉﾉ In Indonesia we change j 'yot' with j 'je' (like English version) and change y 'ypsilon' with y 'ye'

Ja (Dutch) = Ya (Indonesia) Thank you very much for this helpful video! Namaste. So basically french pronunciation with english(ish) words? (ee) (yot) (kah) Super like 0:39 People when I do something remotely feminine I came here so I could sing WMID 😭 now I’m trying to pronounce ‘ERR’ right but I’m looking like a fool. I just started learning German and it's a fascinating language. Some of the alphabet is pronounced the same as in French. Makes it a little easier for me. It's cool that the letter Y almost sounds the same as in Italian. German sounds like a mixture of English and French in my opinion. I’m very late to this and I watched this for review because I have been learning German and you explained stuff way more understandable than me being in a group and not really understanding so thank you!! I lost my shit at orange 😂 Very useful video. Thank you! 8.8 cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 37 Selbsfahrlafette auf 18 ton Zugkraftwagen...
i know some german too Almost same with Indonesian pronounciation Geh looks like gay It's amazing how in our time we can learn anything faster, free and easier you don't need nothing just internet and YouTbe Watching after 7 years I write this all words in my copy Where is the "ü" letter This video makes it seem like German is just English with extra letters Rot (red) is so hard to say as someone with an American accent. Can't even say my favorite color in German. 🙄 15 Additionally it was the first of 12345678910111123141 vielen dank Learning German because I want to pursue my career in Germany 😁 Learning French and German wierd how close they are geographically wise but verbally so different The R (err) part got me chocking so hard learning german is making me too much laugh lol What is the meaning of chor I didn't understand pls tell Upsilon I feel like I am dead from Inside After seeing this I learnt little little german Native Urdu speaker

Hi everyone, I'm just started to learn German and want to know German grammar. For example Subject+V+Object in English. What about German.?
And Which one is more difficult (French and German)? When German is an aggressive language: https://youtu.be/Oy-cArjg3t0 Its similliar with indonesia waww I love Germany am in Germany I want to learn Thanks, Sunny Su! I've been struggling a lot since I came to Germany and now that I'm repeating 6th Grade here, I'd really like to learn this language since my mom isn't always by my side to teach me Deutsch, having the job of taking care to the people in a Home for The Aged, and because of just that, I,d really like to thank you again! When practicing pronouncing the German alphabet turns into NSFW for me because the pronunciation for I and J is inappropriate in my native language cuz it's like the ASL of F and G. Anyone in my house would probably ask me why I'm saying intercourse so loud not knowing that I'm practicing German 😂. I almost started to cry in frustration trying to pronounce "err" 😭 Is the pronunciation of ü she taught in this correct??? Because Google and other apps are giving different pronunciation for this.

I kinda don’t understand why people want to lean German, I speak German and honestly German is such a ugly language. Additionally to that it also has a difficult grammar, which I didn’t understand completely till the 6 grade, and mind that I lived my whole live speaking German. So if you are not a genius, it can take you many years until you can speak German fluently without hearing it in person single everyday My german dog:BARKBARK Me:TWT DAMIT WHATS SHUT UP IN GERMAN This video is enough to learn German, so good,  thank you so much.

Had a friend from Germany that visited my country last year 
Amazing people
He could speak Afrikaans in only 5 months crazy so its my turn I love her.She is so German Tschuss!! 😋😂 Aha: Ein bisSchen!!!! The lesson on how to ask how much something costs brought back funny memory to me.  I was a high school student taking German in the early 80's.  Our teach asked us to write a short verbal exchange in the market.  Here was my Exchange:

Customer to Store clerk:  "Guten Tag. Kannst du mir deine apfel zeigen?  Wie viel Kosten Sie?"

The teacher laughed uncontrollably.  She had to explain it to me. Why did I even watch the full video while I am fluent in german xD Hi Laura! I want to see all your videos! I think you live near or in Bavaria. Because of your accent! So lovely!....I invite you to reply! ........john from minnesota Heigh falsghfhahasshs I am feeling dizzy danke Ihnen Laura Meier 😘 How many Indian's are learning German here  ? Hallo! Ich heiße Gabriel! Schön, dich kennenzulernen! As a dutch person this is much easier than for english speakers because, quite a lot of words are similar For the German speaking people, I have a question for you all:

Okay, so, I live in South Africa, born and raised here and my first language is Afrikaans, which is derived from Dutch. But I also believe we have some strong German roots. My last name is Hagen, is that a German last name? 

My father is from Namibia, where there is still a lot of German speaking people so he grew up hearing the language a lot and has always wanted to learn it. So I'm trying to learn German with him because it has always been one of his wishes and I just like learning new languages. 😊 Hallo.Ich hieß John WICK. After watching this video, my listening skills have improved, English listening skills of course Laura : in the last lesson,we talked about numbers,have you forgotten?

Me : But it was just 1 second ago,how could I forgot it. Danke Bin ich wirklich die einzige Deutsche die sich das anguckt? 😂 im from malaysia but in my schook we have german class Me:
Opens YouTube to learn Spanish prepositions.

2 seconds later:
Sit to watch this entire 25 min video for no reason My brain now 1.46am Thursday 8 July 2021 decided to wanna learn German. I wanna learn German cuz I wanna move there one day Quick Tip: Use an anaesthetic on your tongue before learning. German Tutor: It's very easy.
*Starts with the whole dictionary in first sentence.
How can I untwist my tongue? Can someone answer me? When i say “My German is not very good”, would i use Mein or Meine? Anyone can learn a new language or two but they don't want to put the work. I've been learning German with my daughter for a bit now, we try to communicate in German sometimes and it's been helpful. Im learning English also from you .. thanks alot..so much അമ്മച്ചി സൂപ്പർ Ein bischen (a little) almost sounds like I’m bitching! Lol Am I the only one reading comments instead of listening She looks very german Me: This’ll be easy

Also Me: Hollo, itch hiser Lathan, shon dich kenenlala. im austrian why am I watching this😂 Danke, dass du mir beim Deutschlernen geholfen hast!
thanks for helping me learn german! I am from gemsny but i like lerning more im just 11 i'm turkish and i've always thought that learning german is an impossible mission because of the rules, but i decided to try now. Most helpful video for beginners:) Laura : fatty r u ready 
Me : what the hell r u saying        
Bye 



Did she actually want to say that ?    
I can't understand I think she's so beautiful. German is hard for me i'm from india I know English
And some German Latin mandarin Russian Japanese and Middle High German German pronunciation is so cool! How don't you like it? it's going well so far  :) dont lie, you too are here to invade the reddit comment section. 25 minutes to learn a 3 minute thing? piss off lmao x'D Totally not here in order to read mein kampf I was so surprised I could learn so fast just in 25 mins German . Marketing is excellent skill . 😅 Now I'mma learn Germany language after her introduction, well nevermind skip to the next language 🤣🤣 I have a German cousin. Next time I see her she won’t know what hit her when her cousin that can barely English begins to German hehe. I really want to learn more than two languages so this is an exciting and very informative video to get me started on German:)) I learned a lot of words in just 2 days 😂 Yes me learning 🇩🇪 from 🇮🇳 because germany is my fav football team . Laura has crazy eyes. My name is Fatima, when she started calling Fatty are you ready, i was like o.o I was watching it for fun. I'm German and shake my head this was annouced to be easy (signal term: basics).
But since this obviously is a commercial for a language learning service it is good they don't betray you it is going to be easy... I have a german name, german looks, people just gonna think im stupid when I go to Germany. I'm half german so I'm trying to learn the language 😂 Everyone.so difficult to learn.         Me so easy to learn more            Laura hallo hmvxzf mmmm.     Me super duper boring 😁😂😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 So at 5 am my mind told me to do something extraordinary  !! And see i am here !! 🙄 i like this channel learning two languages at the same time :| Digga ich bin deutscher und schau mir das grad an XDD People making fun of German in comments triggers me a lot ...  Fucking clowns 🤡 She sounds like she has a frog in her throat😂 I like deutsch My last name is ernst and my mothers last name is haase and I still somehow don’t know German I'm dead.
