I m coming to russia.  Thanks for your first lesson. Do you also give coaching in russia? Nedir lan planın kansız Открыто достижениен : Вы призвали русских Prepare a script for your video first, then shoot your video as per your script. Your teaching style is way too slow and boring. I only want to see the fun part of your video, when you introduce me with new Russian words. Just stick to the point, don't just go with any flow or get disstracted with any random thought. I watched your whole video and now i feel like, i can explain your video in half of the time that you have taken. Hope you will address that issue, just be quick and full of information. Cut the rubbish out. arhh... it's a pen.. pen... , hurm... My grand grandmother was Russian and I'm from Croatia. She died before I was born, and I never met her. So I wish to learn the Russian in her honor. She's passionate Hello and Hi in Russian just enough to make me give up 😅 Ithink I'm just learning because honestly I find it a very cool and not so  difficult language as it seems. I love how it sounds too and it feels a bit more confortable to pronounce the words and sentences than some other languages that I was trying to learn lol-
Than you so much for this AMAZING free classes <3 когда хочешь почувствовать себя умным i would repeat the r the most if she were to teach me XD I'm Spanish and I learnt English, I'm already advanced level after studying for a few years. Now it's the time to learn Russian from English, instead of using my mother language. This will be a great challenge in my life. I don't know about this but I've seen shorts before that a guy told that learning Russian is one thing , learning it's grammar is whole new hard thing but to be honest i want to learn Russian but I'm scared if i miss pronounce something Lesson was good untill that fake attitude started popping up.. I don't like Russia because they are in cahoots with the united states I came to look for some minecraft houses and found this Damn... I get messed up London with this "гондон" instead of this "лондон" I am the machine! I like your humour 😄 Russian lessons:  #1 - Disregard everything while Putin rapes your country and your family. Keep your head down and pretend like everything is fine. Водка путин казачка сучке O i love this accent..pree vet I love how she teaches 😍😍😍 Interestiiing...
-I speak Russian all my life My goal is want to know other language from what language I know and its for communication I know some Russian but I’m mostly English I've been practicing for a few days now and have already learned so much and can even roll my rs now but the hardest part is put that р(r) sound in words like профессор.

Learn Russian to find a Russian girl to marry Someone said that language shapes your thinking. Therefore, I want to warn all those who decided to learn Russian. Russian is my native language, but most of all I love English. English is the language of logic, while in Russian there is no logic, it is the language of emotions. I really sympathize with those who decided to study it. 16:00 only a soviet kid can imagine tank from oo I think learning a new language is always fun!

Edits because typos True Friends(They look nice, and they are nice. These are letters which look and sound just like English letters.): A, K, M, O, T
False Friends(They look nice(like the True Friends), but don't be fooled. These look like English letters you're familiar with, but sound different.): V, Je, N, R, S, U, H
New Friends(They might look scary, but you'll warm up to them easily. These are letters you haven't seen before, but they have similar sounds.): B, G, D, Z, I, L, P, F, E
Strangers(These will be the tricky ones. They look different from anything you've seen before(like the New Friends), and don't have similar sounds to English, either.): Jo, Ž, J, C, Ć, Š, Š`, ', Ui, `, Ju, Ja If you've learned Hiragana and Katana, this really isnt intimidating. как I can’t write English cursive, how a, I supposed to write Russian cursive?! 💕 наконец-то способ справиться с двуязычными русками The russian alphabet contains numbers, english letters, korean letters and all of them I know so it'll be easy for me The alphabet and the pronunciation are EXACTLY identical to Greek, and as a Greek its awsome to see that Russian is similar to my language, thanks for the amazing video! црфе еру агсл Ta bardzo przystojna kuzynka naszej Justynki Majdy to cos sie moze to umialo uczyc ale nie mogla na klawiatrze znalezc literki x stop! the lowercase a should be the same as uppercase A I like how the first two letters are "AK".

Just like it’s not the Russian alphabet, it’s the Cyrillic. Враньё. Строчную букву "а" мы так не пишем. Nice and easy way of teaching. Slow and study wins the race. I am planning to read and write the Russian alphabet in this lockdown. Hello I am new here A B V G T E S Nice video 6:15 🤣 A and K, A and K, what Russian word could those two mates make together... I can only think of an abbreviation... kak AK-47. Uh excuse me teacher thats a number I read correctly wow. And I'm also satisfied her teaching style ☺ It would be nice to learn Russian from an actual Russian. I've noticed a trend with the 101 language series to replace native people. It is sad that even in their language and culture where they should be able to represent themselves, there is a genocidal agenda. *Как* B)зачем я это смотрю I can’t wait to be fluent in Russian. I’m on my journey to learn the language. I find it to be really hard to learn, but I will not give up. 3:39 🐶 Dogs just smell each other's butt.  They'll know everything about you. 🤣 Preevyet marina Spaseeba. Yellow bus! You are incredibly beautiful Marina  - more so because your personality just bubbles out! 🍾  YELLOW BLUE BUS 💛😄

Wow!  3 years in USA, and your English is absolutely perfect 👌

By the way, what is the difference between Xopoши y Xopoший?

I learned that и is a vowel, and й is a consonant.  If й is like "j" in Josef Stalin, what is difference between i and ij?  They sound exactly alike!

And then, there is Xopoшo! (a conjugation?) Ты рус I speak several languages...but everyone wants to speak English only. I learn languages just for the hell of it...really, my personal experience. Russia is very sweet language and super easy to learn Wow! I didn't know that in Russian culture, friends share so much detail about their lives! I'm not American, but in my part of the world, we don't usually share that level of detail. I love you In Russia 🇷🇺  was amazing 🤣🤣😂😂😂 Excelente!!!!!!!! do be like American, be like Russian down to earth. Why anybody would move to USA? I wish I can speak Russian bolshoye spaseeba thank you <3 большое сласибо Yellow blue bus to everyone 💙 😅 Большое спасибо! u nas yest' ponimaniye? I swear English to Russian is so hard. Like it’s the only language along with other European languages I can’t speak or pronounce. I know how to pronounce things in Spanish Korean Japanese Chinese Italian French pretty well but that’s because of the Latin and I watch Asian dramas so the sounds are familiar with any European language it’s hard the sound is unfamiliar Kafhi tough hai 🙏 This is terrific. Thank you! Bolshoye spaceeba I am looking forward to going to Russia in September, and this is very helpful. Spaseebo :) Hi..Can you give me ur fb id because I wanna learn Russian language and if any problem comes so I can confirm with you in inbox of fb. I want to learn language You should me more videos like this i'm learning english with your channel and i start to learn russian Im azerbaijani and i know russian without learning it...and im fully azerbaijani....✨MAGIC✨ Большое спасибо Браво, Марина!!!! Bishoe spescbia большое спасибо привет я люблю картофель и я скорпион - русский How do I say 'good luck' in Russian? Love your channel. But I guess, when telling someone "I love you", you should be using the familiar "тебя", not the formal "вac" ;)
Btw, the Russian Facebook is "В Контакте". Большое спасиба 😄😍😍 I already know French and Spanish but now I'm learning Russian 😌 writing спасибо as spaseeba is like writing shit as sheet XD *За вставочки отдельное СПАСИБО* SOS CUBA ZADOROVA! SPASIBA! Непонятно, зачем каверкать русское произношение, и делать его с  американским акцентом? 
Им же важно чисто русское произношение слышать. There should be some way to 👍 a video twice! ♥ Только зачем вводить в заблуждение иностранцев... Часто ли вы слышали где нибудь фразу "Я люблю вас". Очень сомневаюсь. Во-первых, так говорят только в фильмах или в театре, особенно о царской России наверное :) Во-вторых, если уж кто нибудь и говорит, то какая нибудь влюблённая пара, и тогда это будет "Я люблю тебя".
Для иностранцев больше бы подошло: "Вы/Ты мне нравитесь/шься" и многое другое, но точно не "я вас люблю".
Также с "да нет наверное". Далеко не каждый так скажет. Как насчёт таких вариантов: "Скорее нет", "Скорее нет, чем да" "Вряд ли", "Навряд ли",  "Не уверен", "Сложно сказать", "По всем видимости нет", "Маловероятно". Устал вспоминать все варианты. LOVE THIS VEDIO.
thanks for making this informative vedio
want to see more vedio on Russian phrase When she said yellow blue bus i felt that in my soul 😩❤️😂i love learning Russian Mne nravitsya Nice to meet you Marina. Ochin priatna....I have been trying to learn Russian on my own and I cannot get past the alphabet...lol Thank you for letting me know the easy russian phrases ПРИВЕТ I am from Bangladesh🇧🇩!  I love your videos... It is so funny, to hear basic words in Russian. I am astonished that I still know these words for my school time, fifty-five years ago. Now, I study English a little. 
You are a very good teacher and a very beautiful woman. Tanks, also for this video. bol'shoye spaseeba As the native Russian speaker myself, I must correct you: that's a kind of meme now to say that in Russian they used to say "Yes no maybe" (Da nyet navyernoye). In fact though that da in the beginning plays the role of say it intensifier, emotional auxiliary senseless word... What "da nyet navernoye" translates to correctly LITERALLY would be like "Well, no, I think". The word da in Russian language has two meanings, at least. For example, look at da in the phrase "Da budyet svyet" - "Let there be light"... Привет,  Марина! Большое спасибо BOL'SHOYE SPASEEBA My name is marina to  USA for listening to you Bol'shoye Spaseeba ♥ My friend russian: how are you
Me:CYKA BLYAT Bol ayi paseeba I've learn how to say "that dolphin didn't like the movie" in Russian, thanks duolingo Your banny wrote! Здравствуйте как дела?

Tell me please where to put a comma and an exclamation mark,if you can explain it in english,thank you. Bol shoye spaseeba No "Suka blyat!", no like Boots smell -> будь смел (be brave)

Hello from Russia the only thing you really need is сука блять. I'm Russian and I am learning English and I think it would be really helpful to have a learning partner. Just let me know if you want to practice. I just wanted to do a new thing 1:51 That awkward moment when an asian teaches you Russian language In general, I study English, but I decided to find an Englishman who will study Russian with me, and I will study English with him. Спасибочки !!! I am a native Russian speaker. I am looking for a native English speaker who wants to learn Russian using whatsapp Really thank you for teaching Russian but a little problem here,






My tongue isn't working now what should I do???? Changed my name to Svetlana Hello, My name is Emilia, Russian is my native language so I can help you to practice it 
with pleasure. I also speak Ukrainian, English and German. I'm very interested in many topics like psychology, education foreign languages, travelling.I really enjoying  interacting with other people. My email is wemilia607@gmail.com. Do you mind to make a few videos to teach us how to pronounce the lyrics for a few famous Russian songs? That would be great and helpful. Songs such as Nightingale https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUtZY0cOnaw   and  Cossack Lullaby https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNhHiKReN48    It is my idea since I love these 2 songs very much and want to learn them. The problem is I do not know how to sound each word out. Thanks in advance. If you can do it, please let me know. Are you native? Большое спасибо for helping me learn Russia I made my keyboard so that it can write Russian 


Edit: yoooo the number zero in the like English form is like my language the Russian English:nol' my Indonesian language:nol You speak very fast...should slow down so we can follow you..

NIKOLAIIIIIII What Russian looks like to me at first glance:

Hello I'm Wolf = Hekafj fjokl fekdksale This was really fun Прошу прошения, но русские никогда не целуются 3 раза при встрече. Никогда такого не видела) Здравствуйте меня зовут Андрей приятно познакомиться Very nice...how much So which version should I use when I meet Vlad? My god she is so sexy damn Well, I have 6 months to learn enough russian before my trip in decemeber, wish me luck Now I can finally insult the Russians in csgo Привет The only thing that bugs me about Russian is that they have consonants put together that are impossible to pronounce!!! And the changing forms of nouns :(
Почемуyyyyyyyyyy My jawline has broken and now i can't speak any languageFrom Zero to Fluency Exercise book – https://realrussianclub.com/from-zero-to-fluency/ Honestly you do it so amazingly. Hit the nail on the head, don't be mouthy. thats the difference with spanish, in spanish changing the pronunciation changes the meaning U_U I am russian. Ask me. 
Я русский. Задавайте вопросы. new to russian Иногда, уча кого-то русскому, забываешь что в нём так то не мало правил. Например, "Я доктор" правильно пишется "Я - доктор" и подлежащие и сказуемое выражены существительными, так что через тире... Ну да ладно, мелочи) I want to learn Russian for speaking and understanding it not writing what should I do приьет Привет.

Eu tentando aprender russo com uma professora que fala inglês...

Thank you for your videos  They are super easy to understand. You teach with enthusiasm and a passion for wanting to instil learning in a clear, and concise but in a gentle way. 
 You are very informative and educational.

Daria I really like your Zero to fluency Russian lessons here on youtube do you think as I practice I will develop a russian accient Little is more satisfying then using text to speech in google translate and it perfectly understanding my Russian "sentences". SOS CUBA I've started learning Russian and decided to learn only from Daria. Imagine, how much I am convinced about her as my teacher! I've started learning Russian and decided to learn only from Daria. Imagine, how much I am convinced about her as my teacher! cutest teacher ever!!! you make me laugh so much and help me remember what i learn Hi Daria!! Why the letter "o" sounds like an "a" in some words? Like in PECTOPÁN or MOCKBA.

But I am learning russian language 
I like russia and russian girl Holy oyster makes me LOL Please, write Ш and Щ correct!!! for what the hell am i watching it? my native language is russian:-| the o is pronounced a in some occasions it confuses me for example when saying she the o at the beginning is a Come to Brazil! Это Дин. Он инженир. I really know a Dean and he really is an engineer! Russian: no rules
English: rules for everything 

In my journey in learning another language I'm starting to figure out that the rules for english are very strict compared most other languages. And there are plenty of native english speakers that heavily critique poor grammar. Honestly learning russian for me so far is easier than just communicating in english because my vocabulary sucks and my spieling sucks. (not here because spellcheck) why speaks English so often? Beautiful❤️ No verb "to be" and no articles? sounds a bit crazy, but suddenly it makes everything easier. at first i was learning korean then i slowly somehow moved on to russian! ty daria это Дария,она учитель Who else is trying to learn a language during covid bc u got nothing else to do You r hot medam The weird I is just ü in German. *Кот владймер ьеютйфул*
Love from йндйя 🇮🇳❤️🇷🇺 Daria I can't read the letter when you write down on board because they caption word. By the way I'm from Indonesian. The best russian course I've ever seen! Great! Her: no plural today.
Me who uses they/them pronouns : WHYYYY Actually, the English oo has two sounds, long and short. "look" and "book" are short sounds and "loop" and "hoop" are long sounds. The russian y is like the long oo as in loop. The short oo sounds more like oo-eh with the schwa sound at the end. Zhivago honey Actually took Russian but nice refresher. 4:51

Millions of thanks  for  making  such a mesmerizing video Spasibo. Khorosho. Плохое произношение! Ты русский? Погода не хороша(не хорошая).Так правильно. Pretty usefull, but I cannot understand why it is written as O when o pronounced as A? The pronunciation is so CLEAR!! Thank you!!!! привет I'm English How to say ' see you soon" Hallo from Indonesia...
I like your video...

Spasibo😉 Te felicito por tu trabajo !!  Aunque no seas native de Rusia , se nota que sabes enseñar y muy bien por supuesto!!! Saludos desde Korea del Sur .. Aaaaaaa (погода не хорошо)???????????
Что этоVery poor video. Too .fast and confusing To my arab, turk and kurd friends
First, X. Sounds like the kurdish X or the Arabic خ
Ы sounds like the turkish I 
Ж is like the turkish j or the Lebanese ج 
P is pronounced like the Arabic ر and Kurdish R
Л sounds exactly how the Arabic ل sounds like but when it's ЛЪ it sounds like the turkish L in the word "Lamba" 2 i am a native russian speaker why do i watch this My grandson prefectly  speak Russian, by he so lazy American child to  learn just alphabet. ..
I will show him this video.😲😲😉😆 At letter 3 I gave up Dear All.There is no such a thing as a Russian Alphabet.This Alphabet is delivered to Russia from Bulgaria.It is BULGARIAN ALPHABET made during the Bulgarian king BORIS I    and has been made popular  during  king Simeon the GREAT.History is just one.Check it out. I'm just here to learn. Your teaching style is easy to follow. Good job! your letters get smaller as you go что для них звучит почти одинаково в нашем языке совершенно разгые буквы, переосмысливаеш изучение английских букв  между гласными для нас вообще нет разницы dude, your white board is crooked. Не знаю, лично мне всё понятно :) My first ever Russian lesson
Thank you so much bro.
Highly appriciate it.
God bless. Thanks goodness for google translate! very enteresting i always watch russiam movies Thanks for that. But I found your presentation a lot more efficient when played at 1.75 percent of normal speed. 😊 I felt a touch of Phyrexia when he was talking abou F. y are there so many vowels? I'm Serbian and know all of this but it's fun to watch tbh You missed an important fact, the Russian alphabet is not composed of letters, it is composed of sounds. Where does all this Russian PR come from? About "Ш" and "Щ" you're a bit wrong, sound you do for 1st letter is correct, but 2nd is not. in russian its totally different letter and they sound different and easily distinguishable. Lets take word "ЩУКА", if you change the letter and say to any russian speaking this word (e.g. "ШУКА") they will more likely think you mean "СУКА" than "ЩУКА" as it sound actually closer to "С". This much, "Ш" and "Щ" are different in sounding. Also if talking about the difference, you actually can prolong sound of "Ш" like you know (i dont know how to say it)... you can keep sound "ШШШШШШШШ...", but with "Щ" you cannot its short and ends right after it (maybe you can imaging like "ch" and "h", where "hhhhhhh..." is possible to keep sounding, while "ch" is not, its short). TQ will try to acquire Russian language This reminds me of reading sheet music. The symbols can mean to play or sing the music soft or loud. I think the bl sound is what linguists call "schwa". We have the sound in English as an unstressed syllable in words like 'confuse' (1st syllable) or 'cousin' (2nd syllable).  In Turkish it has its own letter; ı (a dotless i). Other posts here have identified other languages where there is a letter or character for the sound. Sorry, I couldn’t get past A. 

English uses the Latin alphabet. 

The long A sound in English is pronounced like the A in “mate”.  The A in “car” is a short A. Millions of black african would want to learn russian to live in Russia, for the beautyful white russian females. Good intro, but the hard sign explanation is a bit off. It does follow consonants, but it does not just "make them hard". For example, the L sound does not need the hard sign to be hard because it is actually already hard without it. Instead, the hard sound makes a vowel after it stumble as if there were 2 words there instead of one. For example, in English we'd say something like "we'd say", and this "we'd" piece sounds completely different from "wed", but although in English it's only used for binding 2 words together, in Russian it would be the same pronunciation effect, but weirdly within 1 word, and there would be no way to expand the word as it would be already complete and in its full version. Is it true that the Russian word for "pizza" is the only word in the language with two ц's in a row? When I was five, and had mastered the English alphabet, my father showed me the Cyrillic alphabet.   A few letters caught my fancy, such as the house with legs, the asterisk, the ten with a hyphen, and of course, the backwards R, but I did not know a word of Russian.   So, one day I got a felt pen, and started writing random Cyrillic letters on the garage wall,  Я, Ж, д and ю.   My father saw my graffiti, and asked if I did that.  I hesitantly said I did, and thought I was in big trouble.  But he said, "Do you know what you just wrote?  You wrote 'I am waiting.'" 25 years ago I took two years of Russian in college. I'm happy to report I still remembered most of the alphabet. I can't speak a full sentence but I remembered most of the sounds! I'm sooooooooooooooooo glad Prof. Macura graded on a curve! Awesome channel and videos. Much love from Texas. Кофе in Russian reminds me of the tagalog word for coffee: kape Мне нравится кофе Мне нравится русский Ж is a second sound of J: [дж]
Щ is just a soft variant of Ш, and I have no idea why we have 2 separate letters in that particular case
(well probably historically there was more difference, but not any more)
so Щ = [ШЬ], but Ш letter never sounds soft, it is always hard, even when followed by the soft sound
and Щ can never sound hard I wish you had been my teacher in Russian I class. Takes me back 46 years to when I learnt Russian at school.  I actually remembered more of the alphabet than I thought I would. Always loved the phonetic nature of the Russian language. Ochin spaciba. So it's like Finnish where one sound is one letter. Even though this says this comment is from James it is actually from his wife, Marianne. We spent one year in St Petersburg in 2003. If I could have stayed another year I am confident I would have been quite able to have been thinking in Russian and communicating well. Of course, my pronunciation would have been much improved too.  Your explanation of the alphabet is very helpful!  Most courses I’ve taken did not help the way you have! I’m going to listen to this one until I refresh my memory about these sounds and then move on. I loved Russian people and I’m so sad that relations between our countries are not so good right now. Thanks for the good work!! I’d say that your pronunciation of Russian would be no different then a Russian would have with English. Day is not an example of y sounding like e at the end of a word. The name "Kelly" or would be an example. The first thing I noticed about Russian is the few but oddly stand out similarities to Spanish. So I looked up if and why that could be the case.

Thank you Goths.

Second is sounds the letters make in any alphabet is different even between languages using the same one. 

I see A I speak AH, I see E I say A. IE would also I. Unlike IË. And IJ does not Y. Unlike EI.

Adjusting again is not that big a deal aside from the too similar ones. Алфавиты легко выучить Cyka Blyat. Did I spell it right? great, thanks ! I am impressed you didn't stain your shirt with that marker in all the hustle. You are right about the letter D. Just like that one, every letter has a meaning. Some of them with small symbol on top even have a numerical value. Good presentation. However... Russian, Bulgarian or Serbian (Cyrillic) alphabet is NOT based on Greek, as some major sources based on the history written by Greeks, would lead you to believe. The alphabet natively called AZBUKA (named after first two letters Az and Buki) is based on much older set of characters that originate in Vinca culture in the Balkans (approximately 5700-4500 BC). Greeks came to Balkans much later and mixed with native Proto-Serbian population and adopted the characters, at least the ones they could pronounce, as their speech apparatus was and still is different. Cyrill and Methodius did not spread the literacy among Slavs, as the Azbuka already existed. They were on the mission from Pope, to introduce Christianity to mainly Moravia in local alphabet. But they, especially Cyril, got the laurels for introducing literacy. And the mainstream history, even in Russia and Serbia, still supports this story. I think my last name would be written as: ХЮЖ Nail?  ?    . Stroke left overs.  Until. Why don't for a lesson. Take a movie with  Russian  sign or marking. A Sub?  Nail you can read Russian.  Russian movie signs  means stop don't touch this. Go back  no food this way,  out of order, Sorry Kris, but this is alphabet is Bulgarian alphabet. lady had all sentences in russian so here i am 😡 In Greek the B is pronounced as a V. Do Russian universities have maser  degree programs in English, such as methods of teaching English, linguistic,literature.????? If yes please mention the name of University. Thanks alot . I'm 65 years old. I have always wondered what the Russian alphabet sounded like. Now I know. Thank you for breaking it down and explaining it so clearly. You are very easy to follow, which means you are a very good teacher. I also think it's fantastic that you are personalizing these lessons for your Mother. It is very heart warming that you love your Mother so much. <3  I'm going to follow at least several more of your lessons because I want to learn some basic and common words, phrases, and expressions. I look forward to learning from your very clear teaching style. (new sub) I am russian why you in my recommendation? liiiike i dont need to learn russian. ok i just grade your pronounce. Please do not stand in front of the white board, so people can look at it while you are speaking from the side of it! It would help beginners greatly! 
Spacebre! To really, really know a subject you need to be able to teach it! Your board is crooked.  Too much useless jibber-jabber. Forget his consultation. If you don't know someone in Russia who speaks the language, knows all about the bureaucracy (locations of gov. services, how and where to make appointments, costs), then you will have a difficult time. I recommend getting temporary residency permission. There's an initial language test you must take. You must have an Appostile done on your criminal record history or lack thereof. If you are in Russia at present, it will require an appointment to Moscow to get fingerprinted and a long waiting game after you mail your prints the U.S. That cost money too. You will be issued a new visa if you are successful, but you must not leave the country longer the 90 days in order to retain your visa. There are other avenues to get work permits using a work visa. Just be prepared to pay taxes regardless, and know the costs and processes. There are social taxes and medical insurance that must be paid too, which is calculated per month. If you do get temporary permission you must define yourself with the government, which will only allow you yo do certain types of work. You can be self employed or work for someone else. Your employer should pay your taxes, but the cost is so high many employers will avoid employing a foreigner. I am sure there's more to be said, but much of the information you can find on the internet. excellent presentation. i will watch this over and over to memorize this presentation. Niye sürekli anasayfama düşüyor? istemiyom kardeşim rusça öğrenmek. are you greek man? The link for "want to teach English" doesn't seem to be working good teacher,i lived in Russia 33 years ,and i am a specialist in Russian and Russian literature.i don't Ph.D in Russian language and literature.i appreciate your good teachings Так так так.. Л в русском языке вроде как относится к твердым звукам.. не надо учить что Л -в русском алфавите - мягкая.. Л - твёрдая..

Thank you Ш and Щ differ like shot and shit. You have almost excellent pronounciation! Thank for channel, i guess it is useful Why am i watching this instead of working? I'm Russian myself! Thank you for the lesson. RRRR..OSHIAN. A great idea would be for the Russians to switch to OUR alphabet, & ditch their unintelligible cyrrilic script. THEN we could at least READ it. привет, как дела, мир тебе হ্যালো আপনি কেমন আছেন, আপনার প্রতি শান্তি বর্ষিত হোক 你好，愿你平安 שלום מה שלומך שלום не смог произнести букву "Ы")) трудная буква для иностранцев англоязычных)) That board is causing havoc with my OCD🤪🤪🤪. Appreciate the vid - I always thought its similar to Western alphabet да, окей, это идеальное время чтобы начать учить русский. да, мне кажется мне это нужно, угу Great presentation. Makes it a whole lot easier Тот случай когда подумал что Дом и Home практически одинаково звучат :) Hahahahahhaahah wtf My dear old babushka of a grandmother was from Minsk.  When  I was a little boy (10)she would say terms of endearment in soft Russian to me.  I never understood being from rural New England. Now 82 and think of her making the immigration to the U.S. when she was only 14 to escape the pogroms.  Solid Russian stock and tough as nails.  She is missed.  I will watch your lessons and think of her struggling to learn English.  Nice presentation. Finally, now I can finally watch Masha and the bear in Russian I'm DELIGHTED to have found you! Thank you very much. Unmentioned: How St. Cyril also incorporated old Hebrew letters (e.g. shin) along with Greek (e.g. phi) to create this syllabary. The whole Russian alphabet really is an unusual amalgamation! It's pretty easy to learn Russian Alphabets using pronunciation of Indian Alphabets (Devnagari Alphabets). We have all these alphabets with exact pronunciations. We also have a concept of joint alphabets, which makes Russian Alphabets even easier to pronounce. Eg: त + स = त्स Just get on with it. But you speak so fast Thanks for everything. Just you speak so fast This was fantastic!! Спасибо! 👍👍 Get on with it  man, stop laboring  we get the point. I became interested in learning Russian when I watched a youtube video by a Russian learning to speak English. This is the best explanation of the Russian alphabet I've seen yet. Thank you! Thank you. I’m gonna use this video for my kid. У каждой из букв кириллицы есть свое название, и если прочесть эти названия в порядке алфавита, получится: «Азъ буки веде. Глаголъ добро есте. Живите зело, земля, и, иже како люди, мыслите нашъ онъ покои. Рцы слово твердо – укъ фърътъ херъ. Цы, черве, шта ъра юсъ яти». Один из вариантов перевода этого текста таков: “Я знаю буквы: письмо это достояние. Трудитесь усердно, земляне, как подобает разумным людям – постигайте мироздание! Несите слово убеждённо: знание – дар Божий! Дерзайте, вникайте, чтобы сущего свет постичь!». 🤕Highly Recommended Channel.
Explanation is the Best for Beginners.
Out of 100 to 150 Russia learning videos which i watched , this is the ultimate I feel.
My wholehearted Thanks to this Teacher.🙏 I  love this teacher ,she makes it so simple for us to understand how Russian language works .

I came so if you say zavut, why do you write zovut ??? Learning memorizing useful sentences  gives very poor results. Because students can't learn many. Every one can learn a few telephone numbers but learning a new telephon number every day is not sustainable. Same thing with sentences.
I think the way to learn languages is to learn to read  stories. Then students can gradually improve their reading skills with the help of the teacher. When they can read fluently and they can read abundantly ( free voluntary reading ,  reading the books they choose) then the brain acquires more and more vocabulary in a sustainable way. And students acquire the grammar too, even though they are not aware of it because it is done subconsciously by the brain. Amazing, I wasn’t told any of these any of these things back when I started learning years ago. After I when out with this russian guy I met years ago on aol I remember his screename that cought my attention neboyayastaboy ever seens I love the russian language. can I merry you Your voice is very  hypnotizing..

s This is way beyond absolute beginners I guess clicking or like wet mouth noises are really common in this language. I thought it was just me Very well made!! but it is for intermediates like me and NOT for beginners. Once again, great video! This is so good USEFUL EXPLanation Where do you go to first learn the words?? Beginners?? Ummm...ok I need the level that comes before beginners then 🤷🏼‍♀️😳 I was just standing there pretending to be watching the people in the questions talking without understanding a thing lmo Сильный акцент выдает нерусских дикторов That's not gor beginners, you mudt be kidding 😸 its really helpful thank you This woman's voice is enthralling...Russian language is so beautiful !

Зачем так делать то автор? Hahahaha, that feelin' when u're russian person  who knows english Not beginner level AT all!!! To me, this sounds a bit Intermediate and between Beginner. And BTW this is for those who are good with Absolute basic Russian. Not Like Beginners or Idk what to say. В принципе ,если это делали иностранцы тo- не плохо, но в повседневной жизни мы так не говорим.
At any rate I don't think that this video is for beginners because we use the word pearl, in my opinion, very very rarely and it shouldn't be in a1 level. For repeating easily:

I learned so much from this. I can understand 2/4 of it. And my answers is correct most of the time :D This is not for beginner beginners but you have to know at least a few words to understand it. Maybe watch their other videos where they teach words. You have to learn at least 2-3 pages of words to understand it. Don't blame the video makers blame yourself and learn words :D!! Have fun on your journey of leeeaaarrrnnniiiiggggg~ till i saw the comments, i felt so depressed, i was like, if it is for beginners, why i am so far away understanding any of them. thanks for releasing This isn't for beginners.Im not "huh-rah-shu-ah" with this. https://anchor.fm/sathish-kumar-vedh8/episodes/Ep-3-Once-upon-a-time-I-was-alone-ea6p7g

Listen this podcast 🤩 just awesome 💯💯❣️ To everyone saying it is not for beginners I'd argue that it is, if you watch beginner listening practice on other languages you'll see it is of a similar difficulty. Russian is a very hard language, it takes a lot of effort and hard work to speak, but you can't lower the standard of how proficient a beginner should be because of this. Its normal that it takes far longer to understand listening practice for in beginners in Russian compared to Spanish for example. (If your native language is English) 90 day practice daily 3 hour Russian is one of those languages where you have to listen and speak and read as much as you possibly can, even if you make mistakes. The more you expose yourself to Russian like these videos, the more you will start to recognize frequently repeated words. Also if you learn words on your own, you will hear them in the things you watch, read, or listen to. It's a delicate balance of seeking out new words and letting your brain pick out words it wants to know from repeated encounters. It's slow-going but studying grammar and formal approaches won't be as effective as jumping in and just letting your spongey mind do its thing. This video doesn't mean you need to magically know all the words. But find the patterns like how in every segment it says "a man and woman are talking" or a similar phrase. After watching a few segments you now know how to say man, woman, talking, etc. Same with the questions and any words you find useful. What do YOU want to talk about? Learn those words and fill in the rest later. how is it for beginners?? МНЕ ПОХУЙ Я ОТЛИЧНО ГОВОРЮ ПО-РУССКИ There are a lot of people crying in this thread but am I the only one who picked up a few words and now understand at the least that our sentence structure’s aren’t the same? It was an informative video ffs I am from Rassian. I need to help in English. I can help in Russian. Мне одному кажется что слово "ожерелье" не для начинающих совсем. К тому же согласен, что тему именно для начинающих, но все же нужно что то полегче.
Am I alone who think that "ожерелье" (I dont know how will it translate to english))) not for beginners. I'm agree, themes of dialougs exactly for beginners, but I think that you should take easier dialougs. 5:25 не классно , мы будто блин алкоголики и каждый день на завтрак пьём пиво , НУ СПАСИБО This is intermediate at the very least; I have been learning for almost 5 years and (although I understand what's going on) there are parts of it that were difficult/that I didn't understand. бля каеф, ток что англ послушал и русский чтобы почувствовать свою мощь ебать) -balshoye spasiba, thank you very much
-nyet means No Harasho means okay?   I only understand Da (yes) and telephono. Utra means morning? Kampani means company? gabriela are you crying at 9:17 ? :( This video is not for only listening, I have to watch it too... You call it for beginers? It is for Putin. Не где находится, а где СТОИТ старый принтер? Касательно принтеров: Мы должны поставить его В ( а не НА) другом конце комнаты. It is one of those, you understand what is being said in dialogue, since you are native speaker) Ughm, everyone complaining about how hard it is. But actually, native speakers, speak way  faster and not that robotic(let alone the fact that all the words are basic). Sometimes I do really think about starting a channel, since most of the videos focus only on rules, when the majority of Russian grammar is made up of exceptions rather than the legitimate rules. I think this is suitable for the A2 level so it's not that easy. I'm not learning Russian right now but I could understand like 3/4 because I know another Slavic language. I need lower level :( lol some answers are wrong you clearly don’t know what the word “beginner” means This is for Dostoevsky I would say this is at least for intermediate -mid to high level speakers Uмирикантцсы тоупые:D It indeed is for beginners... I took two semesters of Russian and this video is perfect practice Что я здесь делаю... лол "Я с нетерпением жду вечеринки" excellent useful expression.... you see I find much of your stuff good Check out my Russian progress video, I understood this video to a reasonable level after 3 months of practice. There’s a great method you can follow to learn fast оптик is an optician  .... they don't say glasses shop .  "той же", and "а про"  are not expressions I've seen before but useful As a beginner do I really need to know how to say "rectangular shape" in Russian?    I think NOT Oh dear "придите ко мне снова на приём" what a  lazy translation.... what about translating "на приём" for us poor intermediate Russian students. Beginners??? NO WAY I can just hear beginners telling their Russian friends in russian "We should specify a particular date".  They would answer in Russian "Yes, that would avoid confusion and ensure completion of their obligations"  What a joke!! QUE I think you will find that "всё"is translated "everything" rather than "it". Despite all my criticism,  this is a very useful video but it is for intermediate and certainly not for beginners. служба доставки пиццы is PIZZA DELIVERY SERVICE?   why do you translate it as "This is a Pizza Station"? Wow!!!  Are you really  trying to tell us that присоединиться is a useful verb for beginners in russian?  I'm not impressed "и вы увидите банк" is  "and you will see a bank"  so why do you translate it as "and you can see a bank".  I recommend when translating : Keep it simple, accurate and try to follow the original word order as much as possible. DO NOT TRY TO EMBELLISH  TO SHOW HOW GOOD YOUR ENGLISH IS Fuck you Sorry to be a pain again  but "Где находится автобусная остановка?"  is best translated as "Where is the bus stop located?". An  inferior less helpul translation is "Where is the bus stop?"   However the latter simply comes from the easier" Где  автобусная остановка?"  and.  NEVER does it mean "where the bus stop is". Keep it simple ... keep it helpful Overall the material is very good as my Russian is poor but here is another example "какои дизайн они выбрали?"  is What design did they choose? AND BETTER FOR LEARNERS than the more fancy "What design did they decide on?" You need to make translations easy and as close to the originals as possible. For example: Что бы вы посоветовали? is muchy better as "what would you advise? " and NOT "What do you reommend?" which might be Что вы рекомендуете?.  Russian is a very difficult language for us to learn. Its easy when absorbed during an infant's sponge years. This is very useful and well made, but it is at least B1 level, and some of the vocabulary is probably even B2, so definitely not for beginners. This is not for beginner Thank you so much if it is for beginners or elementary level. Because it is good method of teaching language. Others should learn I am from Russia, ahah.. Govno I'm a native speaker, I think it's for elementary students, definitely not for those who have started learning Russian from scratch but people speak really slowly in this video if we compare it with the speed of the real life conversation somewhere in a shop or in an office. In a way it wasn't bad but still I guess that they shouldn't have marked it for beginners, it's not actually true) if you want to study Russian, you should be really persistent, it takes a lot of time and effort but it's absolutely worth it!:) Lots of love from Moscow) Great stuff - very useful! :) HI EVERYONE IM GABRIRLLA Who needs help? Im russian baby and i want to help you with this жопа! Я хочу учиться по русски можете меня мало за наукой преслат? Lol, im from russia) it is'nt rly fot beginners)Один из лучших способов выучить русский язык-это общаться с люльми, говорящими на этом языке. Поэтому, может быть кто-нибудь хочет общаться в социальных сетях?
One of the best ways to learn Russian is to communicate with people who speak this language. Therefore, maybe someone wants to communicate in social networks? 1:01

3:30 Wow this guy is so cute 🥰 I love Russian language it's a manly language and I think it can only be used for men ...hehe actually my info got mixed together   .... Wait a second, i thought "goodbye" was "до свидания" not "пока" please help Innerhalb von drei Minuten kann man bereits ein Gespräch auf Russisch führen. One of the best and fun П О к а sounds like a curse word in Japanese. Am I the only Russian? I’m currently trying to learn Russian. I was wondering if you would say как вы if you wanted to ask how someone is doing more formally At 1:24 the phrase to say it back, could someone possibly spell it out in English lettering just so I could confirm I’m pronouncing it correctly ty Good jop 🏆💖 мило, очень люблю смотреть такое:)
хотя в этот момент учу английский🧚🏻‍♀️ onichan bakka ! Please add phonetic English with the Russian writing.  All I learned was "cock tea" means hoe are you when talking to a guy. Lol. Because it's funny.  And that Tea is the same as in spanish for "you" Я носитель русского языка, мой Инстаграм(instagram) @mexerro I'm adopted from Kazakhstan but mother is Russian, don't know anything about the father, learning Russian again. damn thats a complex word for hello. hello in my language is 2 sounds long lmao °°° 1:12 - _Porra!_






(curse equivalent to f*)







Hahahahahhahahahaha рвиет сука как сам? :d Привет :D
Я кстати из России what about До свидания? now that i've watch a decent amount of your vids shouldn't it be Мне хорошо, as it expresses how you're feeling instead of the act of doing good. correct me cause i know i'm wrong. Это хороший словарный запас 🙂😜 Vente paka wey - kto lo entiende? The best channel ♡ Fedor, I think you need to revisit this video. It is definitely incomplete. These привет-пока won’t apply to most of everyday situation, you can’t even use them in a shop let alone workplace and more formal areas. Same for как дела. Unlike English this question is considered personal and you never ask it to a teacher, a doctor, a plumber in your house etc. Also never in my 48 years I have heard “я хорошо”. Honestly. We may say хорошо, but most popular answer is нормально which is normal/ok. Cock Dealer i love so much for teaching us Russian for free!!! So grateful! Thanks a lot Hello, I just wanted to say that I've watched two of your videos and they helped me to understand Russian better. I am learning it as my third language,  I'm new to it. This is the second or third video i see from you, and Im really surprised right know, you make it easy for us. (sorry if my write sucks, Spanish is my native, and i just aqcuire English all this years with music and books) 1:17 sounds like he said "porra" that is a complainment in Portuguese haha How can i move to Russia 😢 спасибо большое But how should I reply to "А у тебя?" или "А ты?" ? If you're not going to provide phonetic pronunciation, this is close to useless. Showing the Russian word while quickly saying the word (what is "hello"? briv-yet? gribilet? byetlik? WHAT?) twice is actually totally useless. Entertaining but not useful. cute teacher Спасибо 🦋 just a reminder. *never, ever say goodbye in Russian to a Japanese friend* Hi! I'm from Russia, and if you want to learn Russian - write, we can communicate in social networks. Practice with a native speaker helps a lot. I'm learning English, and I'm looking for someone who speaks it well or is a native speaker. We will help each other practice in the languages we learn. Can someone please write the phonetic sound of "I'm bad" using English letters for me? For the life of me I cannot understand what letters those are. Sorry, I'm a beginner lol Algum BR por aqui?? Os brasileiros dominam todos os vídeos,por isso fiz essa pergunta How do I type Russian letters on my computer? What program do I need to do that? Я русский you should speak english with russian accent from the movies... Good In my Austrian dialect, bye is "baba" :D This helps because in school now I can start talking to my friends in Russian when I don’t want to talk to them😂 I already did that🤣 But thank you 🙏🏻 *After this video in cs go match*

I wanna makes russian my third language!!! увдимся (don't know if it is correct) cannot be used to say goodbye too? я русский Привет! Меня зовут Моника.

R 6ऋ≧ω≦ʕ•ε•ʔʕ•ε•ʔ Spasiba Thanks a lot It would have been helpful if you counted 1-20 altogether after going through your breakdown to get a sense of continuity. This is how children learn & adults are just children in bigger bodies. I vied to Russia last year - and I smaak the country and its people. I want to learn Russian. Damn she hot asf Real teacher. Keep moving forward what's the background music of this video? could somebody tell me I would like to be your student The background music is quite disturbing. Can it be dropped? Spaseba mam Aaargh - the music. Your charming face and suit voice injected injected us the pleasent atmosphere of Russian number system. Plus wonderful teaching technique.Keep on uploading such kind of interesting video. Omg, she sounds like she’s having phone sex or something, way too sexual This is the best video on this topic that I have seen. Thank You!! Nice Video.
Thanks for the repetition. it make us more easy to understand. Thanks With a beautiful Russian, I am more interested in Russian figures instead of numbers... I love it,  is the 7th language I am learning that awesome. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Thanks for help :)) Best video for learning to count! The music just sounds like noise.  It needs to be more quiet like a class room setting. The volume of the background music is too loud for some people with hearing problems.  Words are distorted by music.  Would be better to remove music all together. really a bad idea to put music over it the dopest number counting in the world Hi my wife Natalia u are so brilliant taught  Russian language I love Russian language  respect Russian pepple and understand their culture in this Indian so I always a dream to marry a russian women I'm deepak dhiman 40 I'm douvce  no kid work in Kier company as a small worker salary is little 800 dtam ima middle class simple honest hardworking man if u.

I am learning more Russian every day. До свидания! Thank you I'm in love... Why, OMG, WHY???  It could be such a great lesson, but the  F...... HORRIBLE "music" gives me a headache and makes it SO hard to concentrate more than 30 seconds, and I had to give up ONLY because of this noise. tsat' - (10) I don't contest the background music effect but Natalia, you have a voice so soothing, hypnotizing... @6:54 I'm starting to fall... awa.. perfect... very good method dear Natalia I love Russia ! I love Russians beautiful people ! I love the Russian Language and i love your Video and last but not least i love you Natalia :D best counting video I've seen i like the way you have made the lesson in addition to the lesson itself, big like Numbers = English letters = Russian letters = [English sounds]:
1 = one = один = [a'din] 
2 = two = два = [dva]
3 = three = три =[tri]
4 = four = четыре = [chi'tyre]
5 = five = пять = [pyat] t - very soft sound
6 = six = шесть = [shest] t - very soft sound
7 = seven = семь = [sem] m - very soft sound
8 = eight = восемь = ['vosem] m - very soft sound
9 = nine = девять = ['devyat] t - very soft sound
10=ten = десять = ['desyat] t - very soft sound
' - stress ......ты такая красивая....как моя жена......надо же такое внешнее сходство...........няшка you have a beautiful voice, there is beautiful music at the background as well, and you give a good explanation, thanks, spasiba.

Иначе будут учить, тратить свое время и силы, а потом: "Женщина! Не мог ли ты повторить?" :Dspasiba kharasho. Its some difficult to see the Russian  words due to using Red colour excellent video!!!!! well done ! ur russian is really helpful for everyone person Alas, this channel is soo underrated Учитель@красивая я учть язык по русский 💙 Very good explanations but the background music makes it almost unwatchable for me. This music might be ok for adding a haunting mood to a documentary on a crime investigation, but it's terrible for the classroom. Awesome Awesome Awesome Now I see where that strange Russian accent, which is impersonated by any American stand-up comedian, comes from. I am falling in love  with the Russian language.  I like its elegance and beauty  but it's so difficult to learn ,definitely is not   a walk in the park teacher I would want to teach us.at first teach us to read because there are letters that are read diferent to those are known the  pronunciation   .it is a suggestion if consider it suitable Natalia.it is nice to see you.I would want you to be friend at first.later the  beloved person.lovely.Alberto Very effective lesson Very nice I’m listening to Russian music and I decided to learn this language and you are the best teacher I’ve found so far. I will continue to study your lessons,I tried a couple of years ago and gave up. I’m going to go over every lesson so I can understand and pronunciate Why this music in the background ? You are teaching very good and your pronounciation is very well, it s useful to people's, thanks God bless you PasebaNatlia Good lesson. I just learned more in one video than probably a dozen others. good, but weird music Большое спасибо за тебя хорошие уроки, но меня беспокоит музыка. так как я не могу точно услышать, как ты произносите слова. Пожалуйста, выложите все новые версии без музык. 

Я надеюсь, что я написал для тебя, чтобы понять это. :-) In INDIA we say chay to tea as u say.вы хороший учитель.спасиба.🍵🙏 what is the BGM of this video? could someone tell me ? thank you very much!!! Spasiba Awesome Spasiba Natalia !!!! If you have any videos apart from youtube like your own learning website. Please let me know. I like your slow pronunciation.

Your pronuncistion not clear.pleas delete da video Super helpful!!! Spasiba🙌🙌 Your Voice  is hypnotic Thanks you are good teacher.. Congratulations This a very intelligent way to approach learning any language from the very beginning! Very well explained in a beautiful, clear voice.

Thanks Natalia you are so cute  Mohamed from egypt you helped me too much I would like to buy USB key of your lessons , can you tell me if it's possible .
Spaciba 
Sincerely  René Lesieux  rene.lesieux@gmail.com Excellent! Short and straight to the point. Ordering food and saying please and thanks is the first thing I usually do when I'm on holiday.
Far too many language videos contain phrases with too many words, or stuff which isn't essential for tourists (like asking how old someone is)
This one only contained stuff I actually need as a tourist. SO NICE.... Wow exactly what i want to learn Russian I love this idioms. Spasibo This was very good.. not too much and not too little and repeating the words slowly. I hope she did more! NATASHA FROM RUSSİA woooooow you are the best. I love. yours THAMIR from Iraq. Ms. Natalia, Hello, I want to say that I just recently started "re-learning" Russian, after having dropped the study like a hot rock, about 15 years ago. I  not only started studying Russian again, but I am studying harder than before, because I have a lot more time to do so. 

I also want to say that compared to the girls around here, where I currently live, in the USA, your beauty, if that is your true photograph  on your video, makes your beauty superior to any lady around here, EXCEPT for another Russian lady  here, in my neighborhood. Great graphics. A smooth building up of vocabulary and phrases. Thank you. amaazing Love the speed of your lessons , not too fast ,  and  , the emphasis you give on the pronunciation of the words . Only drawback is the red used for the words . The contrast makes it difficult to read ,You are an excellent teacher . Спасибо.

E-mail: info@clicktechnologies.us This is a wonderful video, only the music is a little too loud.  It drowns out Natalia's voice.  Natalia, thank you for sharing your beautiful language. Beauty and brains....Thank you Natalia the world cup is just 6 month from now! I need to learn fast You're videos are done very well.  Spasiba!

It's time consuming and you don't learn much in this time and you forget explain it. It doesn't to get into your head this way. Most people haven't a clue how to teach and you are no exception Thank you so much! By the way, your voice is wonderful your pretty I love it a lot. You are my favorite person I have visited Russia several times but I always felt handicapped due to zero knowledge of this very sweet Russian language, I hope next time I will use many of these words frequently. Spashibo Nataliya spasibo Natalia it is very instructive video.i like your examples and practice sessions. thanks Dr. Dinesh Please, Can you add word file with this vocabulary I love it. I want to Lauren Russian language Excellent , but a little bit slower will help! спасибо . come back Natalia ! This is about my favorite Russian web site so far. Beautiful Natalia, thank you for slowly and perfectly pronouncing these words.
=) Thank you so much for these lessons. I'm really enjoying them, and learning a lot. شكرا لك تجياتي  انت مدرسة عظيمة feel there has been so much misunderstanding between our languages for too long...Russian is Beautiful language ....Cnachoo...;) Доброе утро. спасибо !!!! and at 4:55 is a verb overview thanks it help me a lot to pronounce why you showing your building. ???????? I have watched this video over and over and I think it works so I think I have learned something about your video. Spasibo! Good lesson. Impossible language. An English speaker will have to reposition their mouth in angles they're not used to just to pronounce some of the words. It's not like learning an easy language like German for example. Spacibo bolshoi...I like your Russian course and I have learned all the phrases though writing is difficult, how can I learn how to write in Russian? Wow.  The video was very helpful to me . I'm in Russia for almost a week now and I   can help myself out since I started watching your videos. Thanks very much and please post more. Now im here in Russia and i see the importance of learning the language.... Natalia - means "Christmas Day". So your day is coming soon. I hope it goes very well for you as you have blessed so many people with your truly unique (lovely) voice and very efficient method of teaching Russian language! 
большое спасиба!
Сами Love it when you present it like: RUSSIAN PHRASE then ENGLISH EQUIVALENT and then SPELLING. Really good steps for to teach Russian Language Открыть ресторан в России в Екатерининском Борга, и я выиграли от курсов Большое спасибоyou made it easier on us , thank you :) spasiba kharasho. Clearly this is absolutely no truth in the idea that Russian women are the most beautiful ... That ending though xD
Imagine keeping up that matter-of-fact tone with "Кот ушёл от меня. Мне теперь грустно." It's much easier seeing romanised and Cyrillic together, really helps to remember words faster. It’s very easy to understand, hope you have more videos like this Nice cat 😉! hola desde Colombia Your teaching skills are impressive! I pay a russian tutor online. We’ve been meeting every Tuesday and Thursday since this past august and I learned more in 5 min here in your vid than I have with her. Do you have zoom lessons? So sweet Russian girl.

Жаль что она никогда не отвечает комментариям... превосходно.  спасибо, что сделали это для нас. 🎓 "my teacher is beautiful both physically and mentally"🎓 Perfect as this one   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ9jWD64dCE I love to him спасибо за создание этого замечательного видео Это стул на нем сидят,это стол на нем едят... I liked this video she put a lot of effort thanks wowww paganini!!! awesome taste. where’s rachmaninoff, prokofiev, tchaikovsky, and stravinsky?? russian composers need love too Love you Anya. Me reencanto tu vídeo!!! отлично! большое спасибо ! Спасибо. Сегодна я учил много новых глаголов,. На пример: я стою Здравствуйте, как зовут животное, с котором ты играешь? Я забыл его имя. У нас есть собака, которой зовут Фрида KEEP IT SUPER EASYYYYYYYYY........SPEAK SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR.......DANKE She is so nice , i like her native speech "сажусь на кресло"... ясно понятно...

Nice paganini не только вы красивая, но вы очень хорошо преподает. спасибо большое для урока. в конце совсем не смешно... кота бедного жалко. Круто 👍 Тем, кто изучает русский язык, будет очень полезно Anya's the best!!!! Learning Russian is not so easy for the English speakers but she makes it within reach!!!! 1:30 это вода sounds like этам водам.  I've heard this M-suffixing from other speakers too.  Can anyone provide any insight on this? Thank you for making the video its very interesting. Russian women are the most beautiful in the world . what Your channel is really helpful and really help me to understand Russian.  Video is beautifully taken with some break with Russian Scenery. However I feel not easy with the opening music volume which too loud and probably 2-3 times louder than the conversation. The think is I need to repeatedly to lower volume when it come to opening / closing music and need to restore volume when it come to converstation. It will be nice if the music and conversation keeping in the same level of volume. Thanks. Осень интересно 😁😁😁 !!! More videos like that pleaseee in other place ahahaha I'm looking for it !! Красивая девочка Thanks Ana for your lessons
I have been watching the one on serving tea over and over and I'm beginning to get it and also understanding cases a bit. I taught myself Italian but that is easier because so many words are familiar through their Latin origins. But Russian gives me no clues at all. Fascinating! I absolutely love your videos thank you so much! I have a question what apps and materials would you recommend for someone learning Russian You should have your own channel doing teaching Russian in CONEXT. Конечно, это круто, но просто описывать действия и назвать это "Изучение русского легко" очень непросто. Это просто заучивание фраз? Если учить язык, то учить с основ, азбука, семья, числительность, цвета, а потом только можно перейти к окружающим предметам, и то, глагол и грамматику вроде "Я открыВАЮ" а не "открывать" надо вообще под конец ставить. Была бы я носителем другого языка, наверное учила бы по курсам :). very cool !!! Mother Russia ! You are beautiful ! Аня дубрая умная  и красивая спасибо вам Super learning! I like ur slow talking, easy phrases! Love it hmmmm then how about Mega Easy Russian, please? The pace is still too high @.@
Why are O sometimes pronounced like A? x.x ty ochen' krasivaya. cat abuser! She makes it easy to understand. Great hosting Anya! ♥ NIce approach. Very direct. Thanks Im Turkish and this look like tgis is going to be hard! But still pretty good content. спосибо, друга I love you so much darling Мне нравится это видео очень, в этом видео самая красивая девушка и комната и ещё старинный мебель! Я люблю эту дорогу и мне нужен учить много по русский. 

Я не русский поэтому здесь может быть есть ошибка Это красивый язык.. It's such a nice cat to not scratch or bite you ;-) Какой хорошенький кот!)) 😁😺 really funny, love this way of teaching. Thank you so much for the help really. I was enrolled on a course for learning Russian and it helps me in addition. ) Priviet...i'm from Indonesia and i repeated this video 10 time just for learn how to speak Russian...

Nice video👌⚘ Learned most of the alphabet in an hour, now I just need to practice it like ひらがな und カタカナ. Good video 🤘 "The house" is correct ... "The home" is not correct .. superrrr thank you! Your hair looks very pretty that way. Long hair is best for a girl. Super great .. please more like this .. очень полезно That  background song 1:17 I've heard in "La Funcion de la Palabra con Marco Aurelio Denegri" in Peru. He is a great knowledgeable person. 😉👌 HAHAHAHHAHA, the beginning :D Аня, ты такая хороженькая!! If I was President of America I would send the American women to Russia for Russian Women. Exelente exelent video Hello Easy Russian ! hello Ana! very good your lesson. Спасибо, очень полезно. Wow, amazing! Fantastic! Today I saw your videos. They are amazing! May God bless you so much! Thanks for such wonderful videos! Hahaha. What am I doing here? :D Muy buen video Gracias!!! Please ❤❤ i want alot of video like this one , it's very helpful 💗💗 Очень красивая девушка I loved this lesson
Thanks, She's too beautiful to ignore. I subscribed.Не очень точный акцент. What a perfect video ❤😄😄😄 3:04 Preditedopteptitepci slavic country person will learn russian, 20 times faster, then people from other countries, for example:
-
Bulgarian studying Russian for 1 month = a person from France studying Russian for 2 years You could include the spelling of the numbers in the conversations I feel so much better now I've read the comments!  hahaha no way is this absolute beginner level This is perfect!!! <3
I'm Polish thought, so maybe it's easier for me ;D Really useful :) Tahnk you so much I played this video 0.75 slower and it's MUCHHHH BETTER I think this video is pretty good for a beginner within their first 6 months. I have been studying Russian for about 4 months (maybe an 1-2 hours day on average) and I kind of know what's is going on in the scenarios and conversations. But do I understand every word (or even 75 percent)? Absolutely not. But this is helpful for learning new words. Thank god 0/0 😂 I know how to talk having a problem with listening I started to learn  russian today and I know some bad words from cs:go. Maybe one day I will be beginner  :D my listening skill  -100% note:I am also learning english :/ но мы не так говорим... Absolute beginners?????? Rubbish! I can understand but it is not absolute beginners at all....... I am a Polish guy and i know Russian only from CSGO and I understood everything, Kinda funny Russianpod, you and me understand "absolute beginner" very differently. This looks like I don’t even know anything again I keep hearing a word that sounds like "mushina." Stay is that word? Understand nothing 😂😂😂😂 I think this is great - fun, and repeats the same vocabulary so that it sticks. However, I agree with other commenters that it isn't absolute beginner level - I've studied Russian before and have a fairly good grounding in the grammar, numbers, time etc. It's just my vocbulary and comprehension skills that are lacking. There must be easier exercises out there for true beginners. Thank you for the good content! You mean by absolute beginner intermediate? Makes more sense. Fk me the interruptions are annoying af 1. 1:09
2. 2:15
3. 3:19
4. Tell me again how on earth this is for ABSOLUTE beginners?!?! I’ve been studying russian an hour every day for 5 weeks with skype calls to Russian speakers. My teachers say I am not at a level to speak yet but I should try listening to more and I should understand. Я не понимаю!! Not one sentence did I understand... I’m close to giving up! great for intermediate learners - b1 - b2 Beginner level?  I don't think so.  How large a vocabulary do you need to understand this?   Can someone recommend an actual beginners resource for listening? with 3 year study Russian. I think it is fine. about B1 I blelieve. a little better when i put the video in slow motion .75 speed..but beginners no way No meme this time, but just wanted to leave this here. 

So, right after the soviet union collapsed my family along with basically the entire village migrated from Kazakhstan back to Germany (the village consisted of german immigrants, who came to Russia under the rule of Catherine II. and were later relocated from the Wolga river far into the country by Stalin).
My family was part of it and they managed to start over here in Germany. What I now am really grateful for is that apart from being a native German speaker I can mostly understand my family speaking Russian as well, because I grew up with it more or less.
Now what I´m trying to do is also learn the active part of Russian such as speaking and writing, since it always was left behind in a mostly german environment outside home.
Thanks RussianPod 101 for offering this course for free. And I hope that those who are starting from 0 stay motivated, because apart from the memes it is a beautiful language with beautiful people in it! The way they pronounce words is weird af I’m Russian and the speakers sound so bad. The man even has an accent of some kind. The way they make sentences is also very unnatural( I hope it only concerns Russian and not other languages of this series I don’t know about you guys, But other than a few verbs and hard-to-pronounce words I can’t recognize, I think I can understand this just fine Really really perfect you are.. It would be grand if you didn’t put so many adverts in Who tf thought this was for “absolute beginners”!? I am preparing for my Russian A2 exam and I would say this video fits my requirement perfectly well! It is definitely not for absolute beginners, but for beginners who have some background in learning Russian. Ахаха я русский im from russia Fue no entiendo una verga I just learned most of the alphabet and learned how to say Privet.  I thought I was an absolute beginner. if the way they talk is truly an absolute beginner I might as well just quit right now as I am so slow and stupid as to not understand a word they said.  This is disheartening Absolute beginner? Yeah, F you. Reported for misleading title. I've been studying for four months. Although i couldn't understand everything, i could still answer the questions correctly. This is fun. Too many ads and interruptions... когда ты русский. ооо да как хорошо доминировать ок I've studied Russian for two months and I got most of them right. It's certainly not for absolute beginners, but definitely sub-A2. This isnt even CLOSE to beginner. And they are talking WAYYYYY too fast. I get its supposed to sound natural but absolute beginners cant go that fast "Которую книгу" мы так не говорим "Какую книгу". Капец слух режет. Почему носители это не озвучили? Дальше не слушал. Я хорошо понимаю! 💪 Глупость полнейшая. Невозможно слушать, на столько американский акцент. Русские так не разговаривают.  Ору с вас. absolute beginner my a$$ i am know Russia very well. If you will start off Russia. I can help!!!

@sanie_www
insta. Two years ago, I barely understood a word. Now I understand every word. That's what I call progress! 😅 I only understood a few words. With subtitles very helpful У них голос как из мемов в видео:/ i consider this a sink or swim,  at first its shocking but then it 'grows' they speak slow enough and without shaving off words...it's quite complete as far as losing all the distraction and making it practical.  Just pick up a few words over and over until you can fill in the sentences as we go, and as words are recognizable, the idea is to get the gist, then eventually the rest... Okay, this is definitely not for absolute beginners, but not too hard either, because I'm A1 level, and i could understand some words and this way i got some right, and others i had no idea at all. So yeah, probably A2 level. do bre beacher. Well, first of all, I have went through the first dialogue and I can hear that the speakers are clearly not native, they all have an accent. Their pronunciation is good, but the accent is still there. And another thing that needs to be said is that their speech is rather unnatural and most of the sentences they say are not build “the Russian way”.
And yes, I am a native Russian speaker and a Russian teacher. Its very nice video for veginner, большой спасибо I think it is not posible to do a good listening if you are an absolute beginner. I understand what's going on in this podcast in almost in 95 percent, but I am learning this language for one year (more or less frequently) and my mother tongue is polish, with is a little bit similar to russian, but i totally agree that this is not for absolute beginners ;/ This is almost B1 level in my opinion Спасибо за уроки! Админка я узбечка я очень хочу изучать по русски вы можете помогать I'm a beginner and they're speaking way too fast Yo guys, this is actually a really good way of learning, it's fast because that's how THEY TALK, they talk fast in every day conversation, so just practice, if you don't get it the first few times, just listen to it 100 times over, and you'll be able to do it! Don't worry guys Both speakers sounds like germans who good speak Russian but still have a little accent For absolute beginners of intermediate level :))) If you cross out 'absolute' then the title will be accurate. Так смешно смотреть , как другие пытаются учить твой родной язык!😂😂😂😈🇷🇺😆 this is definitely more than a year of learning. not absolute beginner at all I thought instead of человеки they use люди in the plural... Interestingly you can and should do the same in German. In the singular human is Mensch, in the plural it's Menschen, but there exists a second form, a plurale tantum that sounds very similar to the Russian equivalent and is likely related to it etymologically: Leute. Usually the correct plural of Mensch would be Leute, and the plural Menschen is reserved for referring to the species. But in the last decades people more and more resort to Menschen even though they mean Leute. Well, it might not be for absolute beginners, but if you listen it all the way through you will notice that it is a repeating pattern. You will almost all the time find the same people talking to each other (e. g. a man and a woman, a salesman/-woman and a woman etc.) and the vocabulary is not very diverse. As an absolute beginner this is ridiculously complicated, but if you are a little advanced and have learnt how to inflect nouns, adjectives and verbs, it should work out after some time of getting used to it. My Russian listening skills are crap. :( 

Maybe I give up. This is why even hough I paid good money to use RP 101 I have not been there very often. The only thing I did not pay for was their 1 on 1 lesson teacher stuff. So for paying up front for "2"  years, I am completely lost   (((( Disappointed in RP 101   By the way I am a pensioner so that money was a lot of dinners This is not beginners at all " HoW aRe yOur rUsSiAn listening sKilLs"

Considering I've been learning Russian for 3 years and just about heard a few phrases, not too good Gabriella, not too good. If this is for absolute beginners, then I'm way worse at Russian than I thought I was! Wish it had direct translations, otherwise good lesson I'm looking for a language exchange partner I can help your with Spanish or English NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  I've been living in Russia for a year, studying 30 minutes a day, and speaking with locals many times a week.  I can catch a few words but still have NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON. Finally able to get this with self-study; 1 year + 3 months from when I first learned the alphabets.  Today it seems, everything come together for the first time and I no longer rely on subtitles and ventured into questions I've never heard before and got their answers right.  Still need a lot of replay in some places.  Doable, but not for absolute beginner.  ) Also Please scribe my channal as named as "click-Mintika". if you like and share it to your friends...... Я бразилец и изучаю русский язык. Я рад, читобы я понимал все. Спасибо. this is not absolute beginner indeed Du bist sehr nett frau ❤
ich liebe dich ❤ "beginner" All correct, I want to practice Russian plz, I can  help with English , French and Arabic  in return Excellent. But not beginner. I have studied Russian for 3 years, but 3 years ago, this would have been very difficult. This channel is a useful supplement to careful grammar study. What the hell fank you .  you are very good. For absolute beginners?  Way beyond me! Absolute Beginner to me means sub-A1 - this lesson is *way* above that.  The speech is too fast, there are no pauses after sentances to allow comprehension to form and settle - anyone who's just started the language (Absolute Beginner) will drown within the first 20 seconds. Beginners! Hmmmm! Not!. дляшь обедьно хавно липражуха тарилось слувка бажнёть Being in my second year of studying Russian, I understood a good part o the dialogues, but I agree with the commentators wuo say that this is not for absolute beginners, but for those who already have elementary notions of Russian Я был с удовольствием Вот этот вариант мне нравится Сегодня была очень хороший день Привет всемमै फिलहाल world war 2 का अभ्यास कर रहा हूँ । एक बात समझ नही आयी , हिटलर कैसे उच्चारण करते होंगे रशियन ?

Great , thank you Very useful lesson , ty I searched for russian language in google, ang google lead me in this video hha 13:59 actually that looks like 2 1 Super Thanks very much for teaching us. 
Good teacher 👩‍🏫 🎶 "Nobody can judge me because I'm Russian!"
Legit best part Good luck when "шиншилла" and "ииинииима", and "uuuнuuuλλα" look the same. There's plenty of video on how to write russian letters, but not on how to actually right russian words and thus connect letters to each other . Helpfull video Which letters need the loop (curl) in front when they are bound with other letters. Like for instance: Л М Я - i know that before these letters there's a loop.

I kept searching on this fucking internet for a simple question, which is the principal or what letters need the loop in front. And no result. I am so damn angry!!!
Please someone answer me, thank you, Спасибо. Где бы теперь найти подобное видео но только для русских изучающих английский. На youtube не смог найти для себя, к сожалению. 26:32 "Nobody can judge me, because I'm Russian". Lol that makes me feel better knowing there are many ways to spell a letter. Fantastic vid thank you, saving it to my favorites for reference. :)
I don't have enough phlegm to pronounce half of the Russian alphabet. Спасибо!!! I've been studying Russian for about two months now, I know its a bit early for me to learn how to write it, but I think it'll be a helpful thing to learn. Your writing is so pretty and I love watching your videos!
(edit: fixed a typo) When you say "big" and "small", do you mean "capital" and "normal" ? In my first form in school my teacher made a bit different letters, just like in a picture, when you search in google "russian cursive alphabet ", she shows a bit simplified letters like "for fast writing" I write in cursive, but in my native language teachers always told me "I don't want you to write like that 'cause I can't understand" or "I won't accept any more jobs with that letter" (never changed my writing, though), so when I found out Russian is written in cursive it filled me with joy. 💛 Может быть мне стоит выучить английский и греческий курсив? очень облегченная версия) *american people:* reads russian letters like english letters.
*me:* hah, so sweet))
*my niece:* reading B like В[V], H like Н[N], P like Р[R] etc.
*me:* God help! 20:06 it's pi xd MHMMMMM intensifies I wasted a whole paper trying to write ж 😭 THOSE ARE BULGARIAN LETTERS, NOT RUSSIAN. Please stop this ignorance and read history.  There is no such thing as russian cursive. Daria is the CCCP like the old south confederacy of america just curious? А зачем я сюда зашёл? Don't get me wrong, I'm a serious student of Russian, but just wanted to say that watching this, I developed a massive crush on the instructor. How do u write б, Ь she did 3 of them but idk which is which I can only see 2 on here which are б and ь where’s the other ь or whatever it is on the type like what’s the different one I’m confused u probably don’t understand what I’m saying but help I don’t know я не знаю 😭😭 You have a video for literally everything I love this channel Не знаю, что я тут делаю)) некоторые (хотя многие😁) буквы написаны не по правилам каллиграфии, моё педагогическое образование подначивает сделать замечание😆 Good job! Really easy to follow lesson. You are definitely in the right career. Just beginning, the cursive writing on a slant, as a left handed person, can the slant work the other way? Guys my tip for u, just write the first letter as printed))) also i write little ones as printed т, р, х... It's easier (I'm Russian) Thank you so much for doing this!❤ Что это делает в рекомендациях? Хотя ладно, контент лучше чем обычный контент ютуба. Познавательное видео! Shit happens yaiku tembung kasar basa Inggris sing umum digunakake minangka pengamatan eksistensial sing sederhana yen urip kebak kedadeyan sing ora bisa diprediksi, padha karo "Así es la vida" utawa "C'est la vie". Ukara kasebut minangka pangakon manawa ana kedadeyan ala tumrap wong sing ora ana sebab tartamtu.[1][2] Frasa kasebut pisanan diamati ing taun 1964, nanging ora digunakake ing publikasi cetak nganti taun 1983. Minangka alternatif, sanajan ora kurang sopan, amarga "kedadeyan kasebut".[3] X... the only cursive you can type... 𝑥 does anyone know why the cursive is so different from the block version? my imaginary language has better cursive/script version of writing then the entire russian language. Honesly try writing something like лишишь and you see the madness. Idk why I’m writing the small д wrong. I don’t write it as a g, I write it as a d. I guess it’s time to change the mistakes I made in my notebook Me in quarantine learning Russian EU AMO SEUS VÍDEOS , ABRAÇOS DO BRASIL !! Is T pronounced th ? This should be taught on a chalk/white board or digital notepad to save paper and $ If you write 2 ells, will they look like an M? D is exactly the same in english cursive.  😀 Thanks for the tip about the squares, I was just trying to decide what I wanted to buy for notebooks. nobody can judge me cus I'm russian....had to pause there xD Learning this i feel like i forget English language 😕 Curse...ive 😱just discovered 5 minutes ago that You also have this kind of writing. Why hadn’t I guessed? I wonder myself. Maybe my mind was trying to protect me. Still slightly horrified but I suppose I’ll get over it. Thanks by the way. Thank you so much with this :D but then I love to write the printed Russian more than the handwriting XD I love russian The Spencerian script highly influenced the fighting all over the world, and it largely affected the writing system of languages using the Cyrillic alphabet. As you can see, actually write, it’s very noticeable. Actually the smal letter "з" in cursive reminds me of the letter "z" in old german writing. Its called "Sütterlin script". My grandma used to write this script. She was born in 1927. However they went from what basically looks like "A" to an almost English cursive "D" to a lowercase "g" is absolutely beyond me. But I'm intrigued. I'm from Serbia so it's like really easy Здравствуйте, товарищи, и это, где врачи письменно пришли из In soviet russia the pen writes you Единственный урок русского, где 60% комментариев не на русском) Mmhmm, that’s clever. Easy, easily in love COOL А TO Я Есть ещё русский-медицинский курсив или врачебный почерк. Ничего не понятно, но очень интересно ЛОЛ will it be a problrm if i write russian with the letters like printed version ? hi i am from indonesia want to learn russian Daria is an awesome teacher. И где же Вас, автор такие каракули писать учили? Бедные доверчивые иностранцы. Това е българица,глаголица . Funny daria Thank you SO MUCH!!! 💖💖💖 When even my handwriting is worse than Russian cursive Very helpful Very helpful, спасибо большое Nice Like greek 3 in В Thank you for your tutorial I appreciate you and your video It's weird to go from English cursive to Russian. I hope I can soon take actual classes, there are many languages I hope to learn  (: Thanks. Nice video.
Only me thought some of them like japanese? First of all, “ Teacher is Hot “ . Secondly, I have gone through many many ways of learning this fascinating language however I find Daria has the skill, experience, patience and politeness to her presentation therefore I subscribed to her channel and solely follow her. I hope my Russian improves in 100 days What is the book called kindly lemme know It's all fun and games until you try to read Лишили Very helpful. What I've found most interesting is that the initial premise is blown.

I was instructed that the point of cursive handwriting is to NOT lift the ручка. The only times you lift is when dotting i and j and crossing t and x.

All the lifting seems either superfluous or indictment.  

The best part is the connection.  We've seen the memes, but from what I understand, it's almost a point of pride to make things illegible. Just discovered your channel - I love how calmly and clearly you explain things. Спасибо! Very helpful. Thank you. I find working with one or two letters a day helps me retain it more.  Yes it's difficult,  but I find easier is not always better. The hardest part for me is to connect them 😵 Cool video! . Only thing that small russian (r) here doesn't look like other russian cursive tutorials I've watched. In other videos is more similar to big English R (but smaller). I've also watched that there are a few more ways for writing some cursive letters. Very helpful video though. У вас красивые ногти, учительница Дарья This video felt like watching Bob Ross painting. So relaxing and looks easy to do. Then when you have your own canvas it ends up in a mess. Thank you Daria as always a great video you make Russian fun to learn. Wow!! that small "д" looks is "g" this is not useful dumbass Впервые вижу, чтобы "р" так писали. Hi, thank you for taking time to teach us. I have a little question: is the dash above the 't" mandatory?➡️ DOWNLOAD 500 CONVERSATIONAL RUSSIAN SENTENCES (PDF + MP3) HERE: https://boostyourrussianbooks.com Thank you very much for this. I love it!  I'm glad you DID NOT add the written figured pronunciation. This way, you give the learners the opportunity to review and practice the alphabet. The 3 repetitions are great for memorizin. Great job. Cnaciba. I'm going to try learning a language without study the grammar first, to see how I can learn better. I chose russian because I saw this video of an astronaut saying she had to learn it to become one and since going to the space is my most recent dream (and she sounded very cool) here I am! 😊💕 I don't know if I'm going to continue with this or not, but if I do I will tell y'all how it went in a few months Please do make more videos like this. This was excellent I may have said this before, but this is the best Russian language channel on YouTube Best , very best slow and fast Best. Enhances reading ability too , EXCELLENT !!! If you speak russin  you don't use  ты  only in friend Hello there from Norway. Actually I find this woman/teacher to be the very best of all Russian-teachers I have watched so far here on YouTube. But I cant find anywhere where she teaches about Greetings? I must say that I am glad to be here.  Thanks for teaching.  I am new in Russia and I am willing to learn.  You are the best so far.... fuck the ruZZia This an excellent beginner tutorial.  One suggestion to make it better..... in between the Russian phrase and the final English translation, the Russian should be translated literally.  For example:- Большое спасибо literally means "big thanks", the ideal English translation you have listed is "Thank you very much".  As a beginner it would help A LOT to see the literal translation first, then the ideal English translation.
It would help in vocabulary building, and in understanding the word order of Russian phrases. Мне нравится русский язык. Я изучаю это каждый день.🙏🏻👍🏻 THANKS ! You've shared the first lesson that I use as a rookie, it's AWESOME !! Only useful things that are FUNDAMENTALS to LEARN everything else !! so grateful Thank you very much! Wonderful! All the best! brilliant virtually what i have been looking for. only recommendation is to add translation how words would be spelt if pronounced in English.. just like google translate does. Nice tutorial, easy n  Slow on learning Russian! I hope I go to Russia some day! 😊 Great! Your voice is loud enough for me to listen. Thank you for sharing love your video. I enjoy this already, this is my first video I watched of your channel, Instant sub. This is great . slow and easy I just stumbled across your site and channel..
You are a very good teacher! I look forward to your content. 😊 Really helpful! Thank you. I’m in month 10 of Russian language acquisition and these short, clearly spoken and repeated sentences are PERFECT to complement my learning. Спасибо I just love this !!! Excellent. Very useful. Thank you for this lesson. Привет кристина   как дела?  Я очен люблю твой уроки.    до сведания😀 Fantastic video, This is probably one of the best I've seen here on YT. 
No distracting music or weird transitions. No extra talking or explanation, just some straight forward Russian phrases at a perfect pace for new learners. 
Thank you! With this video,I can slowly and easily learn Russian Can anyone clarify to an English speaker what's the correct way to use gender in Russian? I am very much a beginner.  e.g the first one – Is it up to me to 'own' the gender, or does it depend on who I am asking? Hello Fiki's follower Это видео мне много помогает, спасибо. Dayot I finally get to appreciate your style of teaching the Russian language. Thank you Thank you very much ( большое спасибо моя учительница) Дарова друзья Thank you very much. I'd like to watch more movies with subtitles. For example,  the whole film of those films you teached. Teaching is usually too fast, thanks Thank you.  You’re an excellent teacher. 1:57 I just realized, when I recruit a russian soldier in age of empires 3 game, that's what they have been saying! Amazing content!
Can try this instead: slow Russian - fast English - fast Russian I appreciate that your videos are short because they load up faster. Also your choice of useful phrases is the best I’ve seen yet. In addition, the repetition in three different speeds is very helpful for beginners seeking a bit more challenge. Thank you very much. Thank you 🙏 
For your work Thank you very much indeed for slow pronunciation and repeating. Expecting to see advanced teaching videos.. Cool printable cheat sheet. Thanks. :) Спасибо большое ! This style of teaching by repeating is awesome useful, please record more of them,  I would like to buy it the whole collection. Thank you. This is probably a silly question, when an option is either a masculine word or a female word , how is this used, do you have to use the masculine form when addressing a male and the feminine form when addressing a female , or , is it the form you choose depending on if you are male or female . I hope you will forgive my confusion,  and thank you in advance for your help and all the great video. Best wishes Great Hi Kristina. Thanks for another cool video. This video is really very nice. Thank you Большое спасибо, это очень полезный три полоски три по три полоски Best teacher on youtube ❤️ , please keep going. I like the video , it was very useful for me ... I will be waiting for much more videos from you Lady... RUSSIAN IS SO HARD WKKEKDJDJWND thank you so much If I ask are you sure to a man, and I am a woman so I still use the feminine Are you from Russia? Your enunciation is so good and it's  easy to hear how to correctly pronounce the Russian words. I can even listen to this while I'm doing chores at home! Excellent training material!! I just started learning Russian, so I'm listening to all your videos. This one is the most helpful for me. Thanks! Thank you so so so so so much😍😘It helps to learn Russian easily Спасибо большое, Кристина! Вы такая замечательная русская учительница! 😍😎😊 Хорошо уроки 👌🏼 Please make videos of russian cases...☺ In the next lesson would please highlight the Russian word with the translation that it belongs to, пожалуйста , спасибо muito boa sua aula,estou encantado com você,muito simpática e didática,setou aprendendo muito nesta quarentena. parabens! se eu tiver oportunidade quero assistir umas aulas presenciais. Ja, du bist die beste Lehrerin, die ich je gekannt habe. Vielen Dank! Thank you so much for your amazing work! Excellent video Kristina! Please make more video clips like this. Ochen Kharasho! 🐲🐾 Thanks for the video. It's great to hear a REAL person saying the words and not a robot voice  ))   my big frustration is that I try sooooo hard to remember stuff (for a long time now) and when i close my eyes and just listen, there are still so many (more than 50%) words or phrases that 1) i still dont know or 2) they are familiar but i cant automatically know what they are so I need to open my eyes to read your words.   Oh well, I guess more practice needed   ))  And yes, I am sure someone (as they have on other videos) will comment and say that "these are basic, please give something harder", but I will only be saying that when I have mastered all that you have given in these "basic" (but still hard for me), wonderful lessons. May I ask, .........   any suggestions as to how to climb over the wall from knowing a bunch of words to being able to absorb what people are saying in a conversation? I know "practice practice practice" is the most obvious way, but are there any "techniques" to make the practice more efficient please?   EDIT!!!   I just saw that I had commented 7 months ago   )))   Yep, I still think it is a great video   )))))))) I took my last college Russian class the year the WWW was rolled out (1994).  All we had were books and pencils. Like monks in a monastery.  Did not learn much. I signed up for your "News in Slow Russian". It is a great training tool,  and totally worth it.  Please keep the content coming. Thanks! I listened to the first 50 phrases.  They don't seem like ones I'll use right away.  How about phrases devoted to things I'll do in Russia:  exchange currency, buy tickets, order at a restaurant, pay for items in a shop etc.    I know no list can be all inclusive but I don't know when I'll use most of what is spoken here. this program was very useful thank you  бошое сросибо Thanks for this video. Learned a lot! Thanks I liked One of the best ever video. You all did a great job. Wonderful video! Any chance of having  Latin letters with the Cyrillic alphabet. Thank you. This is the channel I’ve been looking for! This vedeo is very useful for me . Thank U So easy to learn Russian with you 👍 Why the letter Г  ( Russian) is pronounced  as V ?  Example:  Того  Такова  етого OMG this video is awesome please don't stop .. i unsubscribed all the other silly russian pages as thet dont have as rich content as yours soo please dont stop we need your videos especially like this one I came upon this video right after watching US news where Trump talked about something he knows better then everyone.......And then saw the phrase of "believing me" in Russian...... Please do for intermediate🙋‍♀️ привет из Турции
🙋‍♀️ A well constructed video!  I enjoyed the slow pace with pronunciation. However, i want to ask you one thing. Is the sound/pronunciation linked with russian from Moscow/St.Peterburg?  As in every country, the pronunciation differs if the person lives in the capital or in the countryside or Siberia!    So explain more about pronunciation tones regions... Thanks! Parecen clases de inglés y no de ruso. thank you so much !!  please keep make videos like this .  ! When is the 'г' pronounced as a w/v and when as a g (as in get) ? You are the best Russian teacher I have found on YouTube. I plan on listening to all of your videos. You’re the best my beautiful teacher There are lots of channels teaching Russian but you are the best I can read Russian signage but can't pronounce them and spoken Russian is fast. I like your lesson very detailed and clear for students like who speaks English as second language and soon Russian will my third. Thank you very much. 🖒🖒 Perfect teacher ! Much better than my Russian wife ))) Hello there! I have a question about the 500 Conversational Russian sentences download. It says that it includes audio, but I was wondering if it is one long audio recording with all the sentences, or if each sentence has its own audio file? If they are not individual audio files, would you be able to release a downloadable version like this? Individual audio files would help so much to make flashcards in a program like Anki. It would be perfect! Thanks for any info Wow! This video is super helpful. I LOVE how you say the phrase 3 times. Keep up the great work 👍🏽 as soon as possible.kak ckora tak vozmoshna.i often uses this
is this ok? большое спасибо I have a question.  For the sentence “He doesn’t have time.” Why didn’t you use “ОН” for He ?  You used “У” instead.  Thanks 🙏 Awesome 👏 lessons.👍 That turtle is very nosy.. He's English is excellent- a native speaker that says "in instead of ing", maybe that's why he sounds strange to some. He certainly helps my Russian learning (hope he does more) - I don't see many, especially with the grasp of Russian for learners! This is easy to learn.. i really like your videos you are a  good  teacher Бежать is not imperfect - it is infinitiv wonderful video!!!! oh, I use it to learn english. not to learn, but to hear and pronounce well Your accent when speaking English is the weirdest I have ever heard Качественно! Great Work!!!
I like your leraning style, very much!
Thank you! Really I found it pretty slow and can follow easily. During the sentence exercises in the 2nd part I would reference them next to an English sentence.  Let me fix you: Мне не нравится это видео, потому что оно содержит неточности по поводу некоторых глаголов, например, точнее было бы "езда на велосипеде". 'Kak' means 'how' and 'kakoe' means 'which'. whats the difference between kak and kakoe good give us more verbs there are abut 500 verbs You have mistaked in your comment - you must be wrote - "Мне(not Меня) не нравится ЭТО(not ЭТОТ) видео". because "Меня" this word uses when you tell about situations - "I was beaten" - "Меня побили". But when you say that "I like icecream", or "I don't like him" you must say "Мне не нравится" but not "Меня". understood? =) i don't think it's very useful for beginners, unless you want to practice pronunciation, the grammar is not explained and it is very confusing for someone who learns russian  thank you @chimpanze34123 thanks for writing I'll try Thanks im a beginner so this is very helpful.Can you do more videos for beginners please? @TheKarate10 
I'm sorry, but I think you are wrong.. The way I see it, there aren't any mistakes. Btw I cannot say the same regarding your comment in Russian ;) @grimmerMD i already can read cryllic and write in russian.. I requesting that he makes a intermediate video ive have passed beginner stage. just saying @RussianPlus please make some more videos it will be more helpful. like intermediatte level. when i said write the words so we can see. i was meaning toward  end of this video. you read the sentences but we couldn't see the words.  @walnuthouse991 ok thanks for your comment he talking way to fast. next video go slower and write the words so we can see  The speaker goes way too fast.   This is only useful for review, not for learning.  Спасибо за хорошее видео! Very Well done!! :)Love it, yeah I can practice reading with correct pronunciation. Большое спасибо. Remind me myself when I learn Korean with 6 years old Korean boy. Children book is perfect for learners. 감사합니다 선생님😍 let's start learning russian from this video Thank you so much this was so helpful Thank you from someone who teaches Russian too and knows how difficult it can be)) I just tried to read this, im sure your son  does it better than me :p And the moral of the story: командная работа заставляет мечту работать Is it only for college? I’m 5th grade elementary. Is it ok?
I mean I can read Russian so good :) I know a little Russian but reading I know FULL Where are stresses!!! you cant teach people without it Why did you ingore "Я" in "Вьітянуть" why you did not pronnoncing it like " vityanote" instead of " viitnote" So "o" in the beginning prononcuad like a ? This story is actually also a nursery rhyme (song) in Chinese "bai luo bo" 拔萝卜
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnD1zHblo0Q I watch this everyday before going to bed , it's been a week now and it's helping a lot !!! Spasibo Go raibh míle maith agat... Thanks very much... I love it when you say - не могут :D Great There are lots of words that we don't use in nowaday. People don't take it too serious please Oh yeah, oh yeah! I read Russian! Spasiba bolshoye! Russians say that to leave without saying goodbye is to 'leave like the English do'. Why we have a reputation in Russia for leaving without saying goodbye is anyone's guess, as we don't do anything of the sort... but ironically, the way this video ended has kinda left me with that feeling. https://youtu.be/Vf9I2zS5dbk Welcome to my channel perfect , exactly what i was looking for . Omg my mum used to tell me this story as a kid Just great!!! I found that language studying can bring me back to the younger days.
with new languages I can learn like a kid and its very refreshing 
I feel everything every word fresh which means just reading books for children like this feel really satisfying 😊
thanks for this video https://youtu.be/ThPMBbqv3lI this is so good thank you so much! ( i m from Turkey) I read with you. Didn't understand the meaning but your tone of reading was very very enjoyable 😍👍 откуда вы? у вас шикарный акцент когда вы говорите по-английски. hope i will be able to read Russian book in the future(i guess fluently speaking Russian is quiet unattainable, especially when i am already 22). thanks for help anyway. Сказка моего детства... Обожала её Damnn i watched this video the first day of starting to learn russian (4 days ago) and I couldn’t pronounce 1 word but fast forward 4 days i can almost read each whole page with maybe only 2-3 errors .. IN FOUR DAYS🤯🤯 Who said Russian sounds violent Very good, but I presume one would have to know the language first. I haven't really a notion what they're saying. Это Баба Яга? Я думаю это да!
Is this Baba Yaga? I think yes! Привет! Классная озвучка ⭐ Хотя мне кажется, что сначала лучше учить языки, читая адаптированные книги. В сказках очень много устаревших и/или ненужных слов))) Title says fish? learning to read in Russian

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OboXqRdXyM&feature=youtu.be Love this! Спасибо большое у вас приятный голос когда вы читаете If you read this message, you will know 5,000 Russian words.

If the English word ends with -tion, then change the ending to -ция (-tsyia), and the translation will be the same.

For example:
Nation - нация (natsyia)
Constitution - конституция ( konstitutsyia)
Transaction - транзакция (tranzaktsyia)
Formation - формация (formatsyia) Do you have any advice for that where can i find easy Russian stories Thank you very much..please do more if you can ;))))) Very beautiful! Are you a native Russian speaker? Or did you grow up bilingual? Because to me you sound like a native in both languages! don't worry what the words mean. Arghhhhh!!!!  Now I'm left wondering what it meant  ha ha  I got a lot of the idea but I was thrown by a couple of words.  That was mean  ha haBUt thank you for a wonderful idea. I hope that I can find more of your work on here.  ))))) (but next time don't be mean ))) tell us a little bit about the story.   ))) I definitely appreciate this video, it has helped me memorize the letters by trying the words first and listening to your pronunciations... thanks! Trying to learn Russian gives me a healthy new respect for my great grandparents trying to learn English! Спасибо большое! Это также полезно для изучения винительного падежа. Привет из Мексики!

Спасибо! Thank you Just watched all of your videos, sad to see you stopped making them.. Please keep them coming, you're very talented and the content quality you are providing is amazing! Best wishes from Croatia :) Thanks for that. I was trying so hard to follow with you  ))  This just keeps showing me how much I do not know. I was also fascinated to listen to hw you seemed t have no accent as you introduced this then you spoke with what sounded to me like --- ha ha   --- real russian. I only have a 300 word vocab at present so I struggle a lot   )) thank you so much...it was very useful <3 Really cool! Thanks so much for posting, it was very useful. Thanks...But it could be best with some vocabularies....go straight on...... Great video, but one mistake . In the second slide in the word ',,тянуть" the stress should be on the second syllable . ТянУть. excellent, thanks , if possible please upload more like this It's so smart and well done. I wish you'd have tons of such reading by the mouse lessons. And your elocation is so clear. Spasibo eto ochin otlochni Teaching!!! Good, молодец I wish I were a Russian child and you were my Mom- lol!

Please start up again, You explain things very well! If would you like to practice russian language - write me This is so amazing
I learned a lot from the video 
thanksI got a ton of these videos on my recommendation page while trying to learn Russian, so I tried a different video i had saved and this listen while you sleep method is sort of weird because I couldn’t sleep with the noise provided by the audio. So about 3 and a half hours in I remembered very little but when I rewatched the video everything sounded familiar. So i’m confused as to what’s happened, did I fall asleep or did time just pass quickly?

But there are 2 potential things to take from that experience. 
1-It keeps you up at night and nothing happens
2-You do kind of remember and it would work to understand a conversation but you wouldn’t be able to speak We've got a job to do Feedback : nice to have the English pronunciation as well (like spa-SEE-ba for thank you) I wish I could sleep 11 hours Good video, but the sound quality of male russian voice is bad, sounds "metallic"/unnatural, especially in slow speed. I’m American. Why all of a sudden do I want to learn Russian? I know some of the words and I know how to do the accent let’s see if this works to add it on.. I hope it does🙏🏼 You call this for beginners? I decided to learn English in this way, woke up British, I do not remember my native language, now I have to learn back my native language. I'm a dlu... Это очень хороший язык.👍👍👍 Thank God this one has a womans voice, I can't go to sleep with some dude talking in my ear ... Please se more womens voices Это безопасный район без мозга лый 😂😂😂😂😈😈😈😈 Russian sleep experiment The video is good but I cant listen to this  to learn while sleeping.The video intro talking & intro are too distracting & loud.
Learning a language over peaceful sleep sounds music is much better, the mind is more open when relaxed,not when I'm startled awake by the video content throughout the video.its good for listening too when awake,just bot for sleep Kgb here I come Does this actually work? WHILE I SLEEP, WHILE SLEEPING, I CANNOT LEARN ANYTHING!!! HA HA! Does this actually work? Learning a language while sleeping? Да, я понял. Где ты ходил в школу? Я скажу ему, что ты звонил. Я не турист. Как давно ты живёшь здесь? Мне немного не хватает практики. Это не далеко! Superb video ....love from Nepal ..and I want to visit Russia soon..... Where is the nearest metro station?! Why anyone would ask for far station! где станция метро? Short and easy... I want to ask you a question, У меня вопрос, short and easy. Why difficult long phrases! The language is difficult already, and plz don't make it more difficult. Thanks for the video anyway 1:40
“Where are your children?”
*”I have one in my car”* Does it repeat certain phrases again in later hours ?? Or all through 11 hours all are different phrases I fell asleep to Russian dash cam videos and now I say "Blyat" all the time. Требуется один эксофлоп русских слов в секунду I like the pronunciation on these but some of theses phrases are entirely absurd in importance im taking my masters in law really? I like this video, but I seriously wish I could EQ that guy's voice and remove half the bass that makes him nearly unintelligible. i’m russian, wtf am i doing here?! Don t use Man voice 
Really bad who's awake?? where is pronuciation of russian sentence.It is easy to understand and learn with pronuciation does this concept actually work? I doubt it my friends :( but I did learn how to calculate without calculator while I was sleeping but I was experiencing a sleeping illness so maybe it doesn't count because I was sleeping 23hours a day so... Nice 69 comments, but im about to ruin it all The woman's pace is perfect. The man speaks too slow, and too fast. best video ever i sen ✅ 👍🏾 Mi abuelita dice:: cómo pueden estudiar con ésa música horrenda y antipedagogica del oscurantismo medieval!!! De qué ciudad son??? What about Norwegian D Seems to me this would only cause disruption of your sleep patterns. Getting sleep is important for health! I just wake up in 5:24:07 😎😎😎😎😎 "Where are your children?"
"I have one in my car."
"Is this a safe area?" this is creepy and who needs to know where my kids are?
and if i work there for nine years like umm yes u pervert Excelente!!!
Gracias Al productor de este Formidable Video. A BLACK BACKGROUND would be really nice to have. People who want to sleep need a dark background with white font. This video is not for day studying. So for your next videos, please place a dark background. Color: #444; or darker. I fell asleep watching this and had a nightmare that a Russian plague doctor was chasing me asking where my children were funny that you think i can sleep about 12 hours... hope i could actualy it s realy annoying sleeping 5 hours per night This is your best video in the series. More like this please! Это потрясающе ! Я просыпаюсь и знаю русский язык! I think it's a bad idea. At night a person needs to rest I had started writing with Russian alphabets to get familiarity with the same. I found this video and it is too good & able to learn with exact pronunciation
Thank You Dear..... 6:24:53

Why do I hear the national anthem of the USSR? i LOVE the slow and clear russian Audio ! My biggest problem in learning The Russian Language was turning the speed WAYYY down.
They're just as worse as the Spanish population.   It's like woah, woah !  Slow it down! Ate a Tudor ,,it’s a miracle ! Any Playlist for Russian language..? Very 1666 Black Death. Bless you after sneezing 🤧 don’t you think .? Great video....the best on YouTube! Спасибо большое 🙏🙏🙏 Welcome to youtube. I see you are a totally new channel. Is there a difference in how many phrases there are in these long vidoes and shorter ones? Excited to see what other languages you add. But I see you have Japanese, Korean and Russian and French so that is a good start :-)Я влюблен в свою прекрасную учительницу русского языка Boo had to let her hair down 👄 I guess half of eastern europe knows bystro bystro. 
The memory of the red army it really sounds like portuguese 🇷🇺❤🇧🇷 Oi! Izvineetye She literally teaches me better than ky teacher! But here's what I'm gonna say
Я не знаю русского You don’t have typical Russian accent. You speak very well in both languages but I would say you did not grow up in Russia. I need to learn russian because I want a russian girlfriend xd If you want to learn Russian better, then join our channel,  мой канал👇
https://youtu.be/tXCqw03A0C4 Well, I'm learning russian with videos in English being Spanish speaker спасибо So easy language i love it I like u russan girl! For F''' oFF you say CUKA BLYAT every csgo player ever The world "Hello" is so important that is repeated twice, 7:12 and 9:40. At 2:00 you say the word "to eat" and at 6:35 "to eat" again but a different way. Which one is the good way?
Thank you! :) This is the most random assortment of words..... 🤔 Спасибо Привет! Спасибо большой из Австралии. Cyka blyat = very useful :) Russian is awesome also like Kaspersky 😁 Спасибо 💜💕 I'm lucky that i'm Czech so i have the upper hand I know some word uh in my keyboard
:да,нет,го,что,привет,я,какие,     idk Definitely need these words spelled out phonetically in Latin letters to help with pronunciation just for fun try if you are indian
open english to russian translator 
and type any indian word or name and hear its pronounciation in russian you will be amazed that every word has proper pronunciation as it should be in  sanskrit 
try krishna  raam or any other name you  will be amazed 
first time i tried i understood that russian is very very silmilar to sanskrit It is very interesting to learn languages ​​from all countries, especially from a big country like Russia.  Even though I have never been there, learning Russian is very fun ❤️👍 I wish there were English alphabet displayed sounding out the words.    There is something very Arabic sounding about Russian. Question: Why is the Russian word for hedgehog useful vocabulary? Are hedgehogs running rampant in Moscow streets? Is there an approaching hedgehog apocalypse?  Or is "hedgehog" a euphemism for some common Russian lascivious conduct? Just curious. Man this language is such a pain in the ass to learn lmfao You Know Russian sounds so complicated maybe Spanish is easier idk how  Did i even learned English This is so useful thank you for the info😉😉😉 *FREE FRENCH CLASSES*
*ON SUNDAY 5PM*

Faithfull student
Gihan panditha So grateful for your thoughtful inclusion of the the Russian words for: lady bug, gorilla, Ottava, hockey, koala,  raspberry, hurricane & other such useful words among the 2000 essential words for foreigners in Russia! Of course I'll need to repeat them hundred of times to remember them, but at least if I ever get lost in Moscow, I would always be able to tell someone - in my  best Russian accent of course - "koala, hurricane, gorilla, lady bug", rasberry, hockey & I'm sure somebody there could direct me straight away to "Ottava"'s mental health asylum. WHEN I HEAR ALL THOSE FOREIGN WORDS USED IN RUSSIAN, I WANT TO VOMIT! Thank you veru much, очень спасибо palace - дворец [drorets] it incorrect pronunciation! [dvArets] is correct!!! BLYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!

*wowie* Hi, I'm Daniel and I'm russian. If you wanna get real language practice, add me in telegram @Dicollars. We will talk rus & eng. thank uuu<3 Я не могу понять логику ютуба, русский мой родной язык, почему я вижу онлайн уроки по изучению русского?😂😂 dinner - ujin is right? I'm just amazed! In Bengali, fire is called 'Agun' and in Russian its called 'Agon '. What a coincidence! Pretty similar! 🤔🤔🤔 Cairo and catolicism very useful ... wtf ?! well i dont need arithmetika or khamaleon that aren't words that a normla person would use frecuently lmao Wi-Fi is being pronounced as Vi-Fi in Russian (labiodental sound V) Very disappointed that you took the other lists off Youtube.  They were very helpful in progressing in the number of words I was learning.  But thank you for putting them up in the first place!!  Spaseba!! From Europe it is not so dificult, many words are the same or close. Where are the list of 500 words gone? Have you removed them? If so, why? They were one of my regular resources. Any response is appreciated. Спасибо большое "Sto trillionov", a word every Russian beginner must know, ha ha . When it's about a verb, it would be wise to add "to" before the English verb. Also, words like "far" are rather understood as adverbs, hence : daleko, rather than dalëky. Very strange word choice Awesome words. I think it would have been better to order them from most used words to least used words imho. Badly recorded !!! This is intermediate/advanced level. 200-300 words is defined as beginner in language learning Can you start another series "100 -2000" with completely new words. I know there is more than 2000 Russian words.  THANKS! I'm here. May I ask what program you used to make the slides? 2000 Words Every Russian Beginner Must Know...Ottawa? Madrid? etc etc Really?! I am a beginner and 80% of the words, so far , I have watched are not important to me at all! Thanks anyway!!!!! Armadillo,sea lion vs. seriously? Will there be a 2100 word video?? So condiment and spice are the same? The best way to learn russian words
is draw or use your imagination that describe the word and use it in a sentence ...the word will soldfy in your mind
Best luck for all 😘 Who wants to practice Russian by WhatsApp? And I would like to learn English Thanks for the video 🤩🤩🤩 🙂 Tysm for these words! They are so helpful and I’m so sorry for all the mean comments Idk how ppl can be so mean Spasiba!!! this is what I was looking for!!!! I don't think Russians pronounce Wi-Fi that way. Tu montrera tes pieds un jour ? Who watched the whole 4.5 hours? FINALLY Beginner doesn't need what catholicisim mean, there are too many words that are needless for beginners Очень хороший преподаватель ❤️😘🌺🙏dubra otra  Natalya Oh Natalia your eyes are killing me. Thanks I’ll come to Moscow for my bf soon. Love #Russia  from #Pakistan Blyat.. russian pronunciation is so hard.. Intro is way too long, come on now Preevyet... I want to learn Russian language to move in Russia help me out. 😁 You looking beautiful You are great and more beautiful Привет ^~^ Yap this is might my 4th language, my future language At some time during the translations, the echo in the room would drown the pronunciations. A little bit hard to clarify the words, good luck to you Natalia. You habe such pretty eyes Don't forget to watch russian movies with english subtitles to get the hang of russian words. Russian people have a wonderful spirit! In spite of all the english influences, they still manage to keep their own special character, language included. Thank you Natalya. Hey Natalia again thank you, you did a very good job with the presentation. I had heard that Spanish has simple pronunciation rules as well, I was beginning to think Russian might be a little harder but your explanation of the simplicity of the rules was very encouraging. You speak English very well, I say this because I have watched some of the other videos on here and have noticed the teachers make mistakes in the use of words that have a similar meaning but in the context English speakers never use those words that way , and in this you have learned English very well, you are very thorough when you research or study a given subject. I am not saying they are bad teachers , from what I have heard English can be a very difficult and confusing language depending on the native language of the learner.  You probably speak English in many ways better than a lot of Americans, but I have heard this is common in all countries, many never correctly learn their own native language, slang is the common vernacular. I just hope I can learn Russian as well as you have learned English...again thank you for all your help! А я из России in the cover you look fun but the video is very serious and formal. i saw other language video, in fact I try perfecting my english pronunciation via youtube, and lot of them are so fun and relax.

but seriously, your contents are very easy to understand. 🖒🖒 Thanks for this very useful video.

Question: Is devoicing of consonants at the end of words an invariable rule, as in German? Or does it just happen in certain situations? Thank you very much. Very nice...very pretty, too ! ! ! thank alot i love your lessons i am trying to teach myself Russian, where is the best place to start? This video is where I think is best to start. if I can't pronounce words I will struggle to learn, although I find this video informative, knowing when a sound is hard or soft is still confusing. 
Спасибо Do again for the future and pass tense very intresting Greetings from Venezuela.
A few days ago I just decided to teaching myself Russian language like I did it with English.
I have found an old material that got me interested in it even I had to find a CASETTE player to listen an audiobook. Yes that old! But I was wondering how the Russian people sounds nowdays and doing my research I have found your videos that now have become quite helpful to me.
I hope one day to visit Russia more specificly a city call Novosibirsk.
Thanks for your help. You are doing a great work.!! Наталья, здравствуйте. Позволю себе сказать, что Вы не совсем правильно объясняете русское произношение. Слово "молоко" произносится не как "малако". Оно произносится как "мы/алако". Пред-пред ударная о и а произносятся как  schwa. Что-то среднее между звуками а и ы. Ближе к ы. Точно также произносятся и заударные звуки а и о. Например, "завтрак" произносится как "зАфтры/к". К сожалению во многих книгах о русском произношении присутствует эта ошибка. Допустим слово "поговорить" НЕ произносится "пагаварить". Оно произносится "пыгыварИть." Эта наука называется орфоэпия. Thank you for helping me. Great lessons! Спасибо танцы you can get paid for this
... Thanks 👍👍👍 Hei Natália Obrigado pelo video, és uma Mulher muito Linda! SPASIBA! This is a VERY helpful series of lessons on pronunciation.  I like to focus on pronunciation first, and continuously, so that as I begin to build a vocabulary I'm not confused by words that deviate from the simple alphabet pronunciations, and so that I don't have to essentially relearn vocabulary after later pronunciation improvement.  Thanks so much for making these complete pronunciation lessons available in a very well organized collection.  Also, for better and worse, I must say that your beautiful piercing blue eyes are at once both captivating, holding my focus, and also distracting, leading my mind off to the idea of traveling sometime soon with the hope of meeting someone as mesmerizingly attractive and smart as you.  Thanks again for your excellent lesson presentations. Thank you nice . greetings - i can show you how to make a very cheap auto-cue (so you don't look like you are reading the screen) are you on VK? shes speaking as if she's seducing pierce brosnan! ROFL! shes speaking as if she's seducing pierce brosnan! ROFL! y do I feel like I'm watching a James bond movie? lol! Thanks for this video. Thank you Natalia, I am just starting to learn Russian, and watching your video today, I feel that you have given everything AND more to help me make progress, because you explain it very precise, and with a lot of detail, and you also use normal language to explain things, like the use of the word 'softness' - you give it to us in a really helpful way, to aid in my understanding. I understood everything you have said in lesson 1, and I think after watching it a few times, I will be happy to move to lesson 2 - I would also like to say, without any agenda, that I could listen to your teaching all day long! It is hypnotic just listening to you. Thank you again, Mark. i just wanna say that...
oh my god you are soooooooooooo beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^_^ <3 <3

About non-native speakers :) Thank You Natalia! Your videos have helped me along the way to understanding the Russian Language - I like your videos Best, perhaps because you include a Lesson - not just a topic and a video on that topic - you teach us some things about the two languages, English and Russian. Thank You! Do Svidanya! this was soooo helpful thankyou very much!! Most beautiful woman! Thank you very much for the video :) Helped me a loooooot Natalia, ...though your pronunciation of English has a definite Russian accent, (but it is so charming!), and, yet, you obviously have a very good mastery of English vocabulary, and, you are very clear in what you are saying. => A Great introductory lesson!   I hope that, someday, I can learn Russian pronunciation, as well, and would like to at least learn to read with some degree of fluency, as I have a few books, (on the subjects of jewelry, and metalworking), that I'd like to be able to translate someday.  Thank you, very much! Thank you for this video! I'm learning Russian right now and your video has really helped me I need Russian girlfriend to teach me the language.  You are so beautiful.  I love your accent too. very understandable.excellent pronunciation.

Меня зовут Kristian. and I like your classes . thank you very much for the uploads I srsly love Russian accents !!!! Hi Natalia xD We have the same name! I love russian, it sounds great to me... I think Russian is difficult, but you can learn everything with effort. Thank you for taking time to do this I really wanted someone who is russian to help me with a doubt.
The name Olga is written ‘Ольга” in russian, right? Ok.
But some magazines wrote the name as “Ольги” and I really wanted to know why, because и has a “i” sound =S
Please, if anyone could answer this, I would be very happy. you're eyes so beautiful ... my partner is Russian so of course she is helping me learn for when I go this year, but this is a great extra help for me. Thank you Открыл из любопытства. Хочу внести предложение: в качестве подарка (не люблю говорить: "бонуса") преподать урок по старославянской азбуке. Какой она была раньше, и что означает таинственное русское выражение: "Азбучная (прописная) истина.
К сожалению об этом-то и не всякий русский человек знает. Если вам понадобится помощь по видео — я это сделаю: я — видеодизайнер и монтажер. Напишите, что вы думаете?

P.S. Вы и правда так прекрасны. )) И косметика вам не нужна. Вы умница и красавица! Thank you for explain hard and soft sound I'm Learning Russian by my own, and for me is especially difficult 'cause here in Brazil we don't have this amount of vowels... Your Videos are helping me a lot and I want to know if there is an easier way to know when we  use the russian cases like the genitive one...I also would like to know how I can pronunciate the letter ы, can I say WI, like in the word width? 
Thank you Hello! My name is Michael. I'm from Brazil. Thanks for the videos. I do not understand about the stress of vowels. I find it difficult to identify when the letter "O" makes the sound of "O" or "a". (Что это?) This was my first video lesson. Didn't know how to set up the lights and they were blinding. Trying not to blink or squint, but can't look straight. Interesting experience. Thank you, I just received my Rosetta Stone CD's for Russian.  I started them and find I needed some help and here I found your link.  ThanksIt will be convenient to understand slowly and with time Very good explanation.

I wanted to say I like the background music it relaxes the mind while listening , I've been in school for the past year studying almost a hundred hours a week or more, I think I may stop with an AA degree and go to Russia and teach English it is way cheaper to continue in college in Russia than to continue in college over here the schools are very good but extremely expensive and I want to learn Russian well and the best way is by  immersion  I wanted to go in to Bio=medical engineering or Microbiology and I could learn these subjects just as well in Russia again thank you for the new videos very very intersting Your accent goes so far up and down in your pitch it’s ridiculous thank you for sharing, you make it really easy to learn. omg the pronountiation in russian sounds like the uneducated romanians talking in romanian. i dont try to critic is just an observation so dont jump on me!!! please come back Natalia ! thanks natalia. I'm from Lithuania and everyone in my family speaks fluent Russian because in Lithuania everyone knows Russian but me because I moved to America.

Excellent! Greetings and thanks from Chile. Nikolaos. Погода I love y I u Natilia, and the lessons. thank you very much Good explanation thanks natalia I am Arab , but I prefer to learn Russian language from English one . Thanks for your help I can't catch the deference between "Мне тепло" and "Мне жарко". жизнь прекрасна Good Lesson. Thanks for the careful explanations as it really helps. Good job! How to say in Russian: "The wind yesterday evening"?
ans: Ветер вчера вечером идёт дождь - It's raining
But direct English translation would be like "the rain goes", or, more specifically, "the rain goes on foot". идёт comes from идти

я иду́ - I go
ты идёшь - You go
 он идёт - He goes ***

Now we can relate "it's raining" to other phrases we know. excellent teacher!! your voice is so clear, easy to understand and follow.

И conjugation  includes
👉  वे सभी  क्रिया जिसके अंत में ить  ending  मे हो तो  उसे и conjugation  कहते हैं।
 उदाहरण:-говорить,  учить,  любить...etc

👉 वे सभी क्रिया जिसका ending ать से हो और उसके पहले ж ,ш  ,ч ,щ  हो तो वर्तमान काल में जब हम conjugation करते हैं तो а  को छोड़ देते हैं।
 उदाहरण  лежать  conjugation
👉 वैसे  क्रिया  जिसका ending еть  से हो तो  वर्तमान काल में जब हम conjugation  करते हैं तो हम е  को छोड़ देते हैं।
 👉हम unstress ending ят  को  ът   से उच्चारण करते हैं 
 उदाहरण :- они смотрят ( смотр ът).
Important point :- ж ,ш,ч,щ  के बाद केवल а,у,и,е लिखते हैं और я ,ю,ы,э  नहीं लिखते हैं
 उदाहरण:- я говорю.  ,они говорят
               Я лежу.    Они лежат
👉first person  में  एकवचन की क्रिया में и conjugation जब करते हैं तब Consonant की अदला - बदली होती है

2.	 वैसे क्रिया जिसका ending ять से हो और उसका infinitive stem  वर्तमान कालstem  से मिलता जुलता हो  तो इसका e-  conjugation type -1  की तरह करते है।
उदाहरण:- читать -  я читаю, мы читаешь,они читают,
Гулять – я гуляю ,мы гуляешь ,они гуляют

Important point :-  रशियन क्रिया का conugation  पता लगाने के लिए हमें  इसका infinitive,first,second person singular form याद रखना होगा।
 उदाहरण:-
E conjugation type -1
Понимать -  я понимаю,ты понимаешь  
E conjugation type -2
Писать.  – я пишу  ,ты пишешь
И conjugation
Лежать. -  я лежу. ,ты лежишь

3.кто &что.  :- кто  और что  के बाद हमें क्रिया एकवचन में ही रख कर प्रश्न पूछना है चाहे उत्तर बहुवचन में ही क्यों नहीं आए।
 उदाहरण:- кто здесь сидит? Здесь сидят студенты.
Что лежит там? Том лежат книги и тетради. Lesson – 8 

1.The stem and the ending of nouns. 
 संज्ञा का मूल रूप और संज्ञा का अंत्याक्षर :::-
 
👉Masculine  noun :-  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में Consonant लगा हुआ हो वह संज्ञा का मूल रूप होता है इसके अलावा masculine noun  के अंत में soft sign  b  लगा हुआ रहता है वह भी संज्ञा के मूल रूप में आता है।
 उदाहरण:-   Стол,    словарь
👉Feminine noun:-    जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में Vowel  а  और я  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसमें а  और я ending होगा और इसके अलावा feminine noun  में soft sign b  लगा हुआ रहे तो यह  संज्ञा का मूल रूप होता है।
 उदाहरण: -дверь , комната, аудитория  यहां а  और я ending  है।
👉 Neuter noun :-  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में  vowel o और e लगा हुआ रहे तो उसमें o और e ending   होगा।
 उदाहरण:- окно, поле   यहां o  और e ending है।



2.The plural of nouns :- संज्ञा का बहुवचन :- :- 
 संज्ञा का बहुवचन हम तब प्राप्त करते हैं जब हम संज्ञा के मूल रूप  के अंत में vowel  को जोड़ते हैं।
👉Masculine noun:- 
 Point no 1. जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में hard consonant (б , в, г ,д ,ж ,з, й ,к ,л, м,н ,п, р, с ,т ,ф  ,х ,ц ,ш)  रहे तो  उस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में ы  जोड़ते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- студент – студенты
Point no 2.  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में й  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и  लगा देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:-  санаторий – санатории
Point no 3.  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में soft sign b लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и लगा देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- портфель – портфели
Point no 4.  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में г ,к, х , ж ,ш ,ч ,щ  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसके बाद सिर्फ और सिर्फ и  लिखते हैं ।
 उदाहरण:- уро́к- уро́ки ,   каранда́ш- карандаши́


👉 Feminine noun :-  
Point no 1.जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में vowel а  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर ы लिख देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- газета – газеты
Point no 2 . जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में vowel я  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и लिख देते हैं।

👉Neuter noun :-  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में vowel  o  और e  रहे तो  उसको बदलकर а  और я  लिखते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- окно – окна  , поле – поля.
Important point :-  हम लोग जब संज्ञा का बहुवचन बनाते हैं तब  अगर संज्ञा के अंत में и  आ रहा  हो तो उसके पहले soft sign b  नहीं लिखते हैं।
Important point :-  हम लोग जब संज्ञा का बहुवचन बनाते हैं तब तब किसी में stress चेंज होता है और किसी में stress चेंज नहीं होता है  और यह नियम masculine, feminine,  और neuter  तीनों पर लागू होता है।


     
4.   Это  :- это   का अनुवाद जब हम अंग्रेजी में करते हैं तो उसका मतलब This is या These are होता है ।
उदाहरण:- это книга.   This is a book.
                Это книги.  These are books.
5.  .The word order of a russian sentence.  रशियन  वाक्य में शब्द क्रम :  :-
 रशियन भाषा में  समय और स्थान के लिए जो Adverbial modifier (विशेषणात्मक संशोधक) उसको हम हमेशा वाक्य में सबसे पहले लिखते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- утром том завтракает.  Tom has breakfast in the morning.
Дома мы омдыхаем. We rest at home.
Important point:- रशियन भाषा में समय और स्थान के लिए जो Adverbial modifier (विशेषणात्मक संशोधक) आते हैं उसके बाद comma  नहीं लगाते हैं।
Important point :-  प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में  समय और स्थान के लिए  जो adverbial modifiers  लगाते हैं उसको हम वाक्य के सबसे अंत में लिखते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- что вы делаете вечером?
6.Logical stress:-      रशियन भाषा में वाक्य का शब्दक्रम
बदलता है और यह logical stress के ऊपर निर्भर करता है और जो शब्द logically stressed  होगा उसको वाक्य के अंत में हम लिखेंगे और उसमें शब्द एक सवाल का जवाब है।
 उदाहरण:- кто чита́ет? - читает том.
где чита́ет том? - том чита́ем дома.
когда́ том чита́ем? - том чита́ем у́тром.
как чита́ем том? -  том чита́ем хорошо́.
Very very Important point :-  एक अंग्रेजी वाक्य में There is/There are  की संरचना वाले वाक्य का  रशियन भाषा में जब हम अनुवाद करते हैं तो adverbial  modifier को वाक्य के शुरू में लिखते हैं नहीं तो इसका मतलब पूरी तरह से बदल जाता है।
 उदाहरण:- шкаф сле́ва. The cupboard is on the left. इस  वाक्य में adverbial modifier  को वाक्य के अंत में रखा गया है  जिससे इसका मतलब बदल गया है। इस  वाक्य में stress adverbial modifier  पर पड़ रहा है।
сле́ва шкаф. There is a cupboard on the left. इस वाक्य में adverbial modifier  को वाक्य के  शुरू में रखा गया है  जिससे इसका मतलब बदल गया है। इस  वाक्य में stress  subject  के ऊपर पड़ रहा है।
Note :- тоже  अपने प्रमुख शब्द के पहले आता है  यह ना तो   वाक्य के शुरुआत में आता है और और ना ही वाक्य समाप्त होने के बाद आता है।
 उदाहरण:-  том тоже  студент.
                 Он може  хорошо читает.
7.complete  and short answers:   संपूर्ण और छोटा उत्तर-       
  जैसा कि हम लोग जानते हैं बातचीत में हम लोग संपूर्ण उत्तर और छोटा उत्तर भी देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- кто он?   -   он студент (complete answer)  – студент(short answer). 
8.вечер ,утра  :- रशियन वाक्य में вечер ,утра  जो प्रकार है उसमें अंग्रेजी के समान कोई सर्वनाम(pronoun) नहीं है।
 उदाहरण:- вечер – It is evening . Вечер  अपने आप में पूरा वाक्य है।
Сейчас утра – It is morning now.
Утром урок.- we have a lesson in the morning. Lesson -7
Point no :- 4  The word order of russian sentence                                                                रशियन वाक्य में शब्द का कर्म : -

👉 Affirmative sentences(  सकारात्मक वाक्य में शब्द कर्म  ) :-  सकारात्मक वाक्य में आमतौर पर Subject (कर्त्ता) predicate  के पहले आता है predicate का मतलब Subject (कर्त्ता) के बाद जो कुछ भी आएगा वह predicate होगा ।
 उदाहरण:-   I  eat mango.  यहां I Subject (कर्त्ता) है और  इसमें eat mango  predicate  है ।
Том читает.  Том  is sub and predicate  Is читает. 

👉 आमतौर पर (adverbs of manner ) रीतिवाचक क्रिया विशेषण (verb) क्रिया के पहले होता है।
 उदाहरण:- том  хорошо  читаем. 
 यहां том is subject,  хорошо is adverbs of manner, and читаеть is verb with -em conjugation.
👉  प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में शब्द कर्म बिना प्रश्नवाचक शब्द का (sentence order in interrogative sentence without question word):-     
 प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य ( interrogative sentence) में शब्द कर्म (word order) जिसमें प्रश्नवाचक शब्द (interrogative word – как ,где, что,кто  नहीं हो उसको हम सकारात्मक वाक्य के तरह ही सजाते हैं  और प्रश्न को हम  केवल स्वर उच्चारण के द्वारा प्रकट करते हैं
 उदाहरण :-  बाजार जाओगे? खाना खाओगे? इस वाक्य में जाओगे खाओगे के ऊपर ज्यादा दबाव पड़ रहा है या जाओगे खाओगे का आवाज बाजार और खाना से ज्यादा ऊंचा है जिससे यह पता चलता है कि यहां पर प्रश्न पूछा जा रहा है ठीक उसी तरह रशियन भाषा में हम लोग केवल स्वर उच्चारण के द्वारा प्रश्न को प्रकट करते हैं यदि उसमें प्रश्नवाचक शब्द नहीं हो।
 उदाहरण:- том читает?  इस वाक्य में कोई  प्रश्नवाचक शब्द  नहीं है प्रश्नवाचक शब्द का मतलब (как,где,что,,кто).
Том работает? यहां पर भी प्रश्नवाचक शब्द नहीं है।
👉 प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में शब्द कर्म जिसमें  प्रश्नवाचक शब्द हो (sentence order in interrogative sentence with question word):-     
 प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य  (interrogative sentence ) में शब्द कर्म(word order) जिसमें प्रश्नवाचक शब्द(interrogative word)  भी शामिल हो आमतौर पर यह सकारात्मक वाक्य(affirmative sentence) से अलग होता है यदि उसमें कर्त्ता(subject) एक संज्ञा हो।
 उदाहरण:- что делает том?   Or  что  том делает?
                Как читает Эмма? Or  kak эмма читает?
 यहां subject(Том,Эмма) interrogative word के बाद  आया है और verb के बाद भी आया है दोनों ही रूप सही है आप कैसे भी बोल सकते हैं।
👉 और यदि subject (personal pronoun) हो तो इसमें शब्द कर्म(word order) नहीं बदलता है  और प्रश्नवाचक शब्द(interrogative sentence) के बाद personal pronoun(он,оно,она....) आएगा।
 उदाहरण:- что он делает?  यहां он  interrogative word के बाद आया है और हमेशा interrogative word  के बाद में और उसके साथ  ही personal  pronoun  आएगा।
Как она читает?

Point no -6  Adverb of manner रीतिवाचक क्रिया विशेषण
वे शब्द जो क्रिया का माप (मात्रा) देते हैं उन्हें Adverbs of manner  कहा जाता है। हिंदी में हम इसे 9 भागों में बांटते हैं जो हमें क्रिया करने का तरीका बताते हैं।
1. विधि वाचक (Method) 
e.g. धीरे-धीरे (slowly), हाथों हाथ (on hand), सुखपूर्वक (happily), शीघ्र (urgently)
2. निष्चयवाचक (Decisiveness)
e.g. जरूर (sure), नि: सन्देह (without doubt)
3. अनिष्चयवाचक (Indecisiveness)
e.g. अक्सर (occasionally), कदाचित (never), शायद (maybe), संभवत: (possibly) ।
4. हेतु वाचक (Purpose)
e.g. अतएव (at-last), इसलिए (therefore), किस लिए (for what), क्यों (why)
5. निशेधवाचक (Prohibition )e.g. नहीं (no), मत (don’t), न (don’t/no), कभी नहीं (never)
6. प्रष्न वाचक (Interrogative)
e.g. कैसे (how), क्यों (why)
7. स्वीकृतिवाचक (Permission)
e.g. हाँ (yes), जी (yes), सच (truth), बिल्कुल (sure), ठीक (right)
8. अवधारण वाचक (Concept)
e.g. भर (full), तक (up to, by), मात्र (only)
9. आकस्मिकतावाचक (Suddenness) 
e.g. अचानक (suddenly), सहसा (at sudden)
 ज्यादातर अंग्रेजी में Adverbs of manner  शब्द के अंत में  ly होता है जबकि ज्यादातर रशियन में Adverbs of manner  के अंत में o होता है।
Example:-  хорошо ,плохо , быстро,медленно, тихо. .............etc

Point no -7 The conjuction Ho
Conjuction :-    धाराओं या वाक्यों को जोड़ने वाला शब्द या शब्दों का समूह (and, but, although ,because ,when ,if  ,niether.   Etc )  को conjuction  कहते हैं।
Но :- conjuction  ( Но )  का प्रयोग हम वाक्य में बिना не के करते हैं और उसका मतलब But होता है।
 उदाहरण:- 
           Она читает медленно, но  правильно.  
                         का मतलब 
                    She reads slowly but correctly. Grammar lesson 7
1.	 Personal pronouns – 
   я  का मतलब -I                    Ты का मतलब -you                                          Он का मतलब - He                                        Она का मतलब- she                                          Оно का मतलब -It                                        Мы का मतलब  -we                                       Вы का मतलब  - you                                    Они का मतलब-they
	Note –         Я को सिर्फ  वाक्य के शुरू में बड़ी अक्षर में      लिखते है।
	Ты  का प्रयोग दोस्त , संबंधी, बच्चे ,अपने परिवार के सदस्यों और जानवरों के साथ करते हैं। इसका प्रयोग Informal होता है
	Вы    का प्रयोग हम वैसे लोगों से करते हैं जिसको हम अच्छे से नहीं जानते हैं और यह आदर का भाव प्रकट करने के लिए  प्रयोग किया जाता है चाहे वह 1 लोग हो या अनेक हम вы का प्रयोग करेंगे यह polite और formal  फार्म होता है।
2.Russian infinitives - verb के मूल रूप  को Infinitive कहते हैं और रशियन में जिस  क्रिया(verb) में  stem और  suffix जुड़ा हुआ हो वह Russian infinitive है।
 उदाहरण  :- читать    यहां чита  stem  है और -ть suffix  है।
3.The present tense . Conjugation -   वर्तमान काल में क्रिया का जो रूप है वह Personal pronoun के अनुसार अलग-अलग प्रयोग होता है और इस पर्सनल pronoun और verb को हम लोग एक साथ ही पढ़ते हैं।
 Russian verb  में क्रिया रूप एक जैसा नहीं होता है इसके भी दो तीन प्रकार हैं।
	वर्तमान काल में रशियन  भाषा में मैं करता हूं(present indifinite tense) और मैं कर रहा हूं(present continuous tense)  इस दोनों का ( Conjugation क्रिया रूप) एक ही होगा।
 उदाहरण:-  मैं पढ़ता हूं / मैं पढ़ रहा हूं :- я читаю.
 पहला प्रकार :-        e conjugation type- 1
       verb – Знать.          Present tense Stem – зна  
я зна́ю             I know.
ты зна́ешь       you (familiar ) know.
о́н зна́ет           He knows.
она́ зна́ет        she knows.
оно́ зна́ет        It knows.
мы зна́ем      we know.
вы зна́ете       you (polite/plural) know.
они́ зна́ют      They know.
 ज्यादातर रशियन  क्रिया(Russuan verb)  में   -ать    से क्रिया की समाप्ति हो रहा हो तो इसी तरह का क्रिया रूप(conjugation)  लगता है और इसे हम   e туре या туре 1  कहते हैं। और इसका stress चेंज नहीं होता है
 दूसरा प्रकार :::-    e conjugation type-  2
 Verb:-  писа́ть.  
  present tense  stem -   пи́ш
я пишу́             I write.
ты  пи́шешь   you( familiar)  write.
он пи́шет        He writes/ He is writing
она́ пи́шет    she writes/she is writing
оно́ пи́шет    It writes/ It is writing.
мы пи́шем     we write.
вы пи́шете    you (polite/plural) write.
они́ пи́шут     They write.

Type -1  я зна́ю       &     они́ зна́ют
Type- 2 я пишу́       &     они́ пи́шут
  पहला प्रकार में Я  के साथ क्रिया रूप ю  और они  के साथ  क्रिया रूप(conjugation) ют   लगता है जबकि  दूसरे प्रकार में Я  के साथ क्रिया रूप(conjugation)   у́  और они  के साथ ут  लगता है पहले प्रकार में कोई stress चेंज नहीं होता है जबकि दूसरे प्रकार में stress  चेंज होता है। Lesson  -6           पाठ - 6

5.это словарь.
6.это комната. 9.gender rule:-     जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में ж ,ш ,ч ,щ  रहे तो वह स्त्रीलिंग या पुल्लिंग होगा और अगर ж,ш,ч,щ  के साथ soft sign ь  रहे तो वह स्त्रीलिंग ही होगा।
 उदाहरण :- товарищ -masculine  , ночь – feminine. Exercise. 9
1.Possessive Pronoun(अधिकारवाचक सर्वनाम):- जब personal pronoun का इस्तेमाल किसी वस्तु से किसी का अधिकार बताने के लिए किया जाता है तो उसे possessive pronoun कहते है| आसान भाषा में कोई भी वस्तु किसकी है, यह बताने के लिए अधिकारवाचक सर्वनाम का इस्तेमाल करते है| नाम से ही स्पष्ट है कि कोई वस्तु पर किसका अधिकार है|  अंग्रेजी में possessive pronoun , I  का mine,  he  का his, she  का her ....etc.  ठीक उसी तरह रशियन भाषा में possessive pronoun  होता है जैसे  आप नीचे देख सकते हैं

	whose	my	your(s)	our(s)	your(s)	his	her	their	Noun

•	мой, твой, наш, ваш are used to modify masculine nouns;
•	моя, твоя, наша, ваша are used to modify feminine nouns;
•	моё, твоё, наше, ваше are used to modify neuter nouns;
•	мои, твои, наши, ваши are used to modify plural nouns.
👉 रशियन भाषा में possessive pronoun decline  होता है मतलब उसका ending change होता है और यह Change लिंग(  Gender) ,case  (स्थिति)  , number( संख्या)  के ऊपर निर्भर करता है।
👉 उदाहरण के लिए я का роssessive pronoun  पुल्लिंग  ( masculine gender) के लिए Moй  होगा ,स्त्रीलिंग के लिए моя होगा ,neuter  के लिए moё  होगा जबकि बहुवचन (plural) के लिए мои  होगा।
👉The possessive pronoun твой personal pronoun ты(you)  के अनुरूप  प्रयोग होगा ठीक उसी तरह ваш  के लिए personal pronoun вы  होगा।
 उदाहरण:- том, это твой тетрради? (ты)
 यहां ты  का plural form твой प्रयोग होगा।
👉 यदि अधिकारवाचक सर्वनाम और वह वस्तु जो वाक्य के  कर्ता को संदर्भित करता है तो आम तौर पर pronoun  को छोड़ दिया जाता है।
•	Я читаю учебник. I am reading my textbook..

 👉आप रशियन Possessive pronoun को ऊपर दिए गए diagram से समझ सकते हैं।
 👉रशियन भाषा में он , она, они के लिए possessive pronoun его, её, их  होगा और इसमें स्त्रीलिंग, पुल्लिंग उभयलिंग और बहुवचन सभी के लिए एक ही फॉर्म होगा।
👉Note :-  आपको इसका spelling  और pronunciation  पर ध्यान देना है।
 जैसे мой  इसका उच्चारण ( मोइ )  होगा  जबकि мои   इसका उच्चारण (मअइ)  होगा।  क्योंकि мой  मैं कोई  vowel नहीं है जबकि мои  में и  vowel है।  ठीक उसी तरह твой  और твои   में भी ऐसा ही है।

2.The intonation of interrogative sentences cointaining a possessive pronoun  प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में स्वरोच्चारण जिसमें अधिकार वाचक सर्वनाम हो:-
 यदि प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में अधिकार वाचक सर्वनाम(possessive pronoun) मुख्य शब्द हो
  तो सर्वनाम के stressed syllable  पर आवाज  के      स्वर को धीरे-धीरे ऊंचा करते हैं
 उदाहरण :- это твой дом?   यहां твой पर सबसे ज्यादा स्वर ऊंचा होगा।
3.The interrogative pronoun чей?(whose?) प्रश्नवाचक सर्वनाम чей?     :-possessive pronoun  के लिए प्रश्न чей  होगा

Masculine
Feminine
Neuter
Plural	чей?
чья?
чьё?
чьи?
  यहां पुल्लिंग के लिए чей, स्त्रीलिंग के लिए чья, उभयलिंग के लिए чьё ,बहुवचन के लिए чьи का प्रयोग करते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- чей это словарь? Это мой словарь.(complete answer).  Мой. (short answer).

4. The construction у меня есть (I have (got) ):- संरचना у меня есть (i have (got)):-      
👉Есть verb быть का वर्तमान काल का फॉर्म है जो एकवचन और बहुवचन दोनों में समान रहता है।
👉 प्रश्न पूछने में केवल आवाज का उतार-चढ़ाव होता है जबकि  वाक्य का शब्द क्रम नहीं बदलता है।
👉 हम लोग जानते हैंесть -to be का फॉर्म है इसलिए इसको हम नहीं लिखते हैं
उदाहरणсейчас у нас урок. – now we have a class.
Important point :-  रशियन भाषा में Subject वाक्य  के अंत में भी रह सकता है और उसके पहले Predicate  रहेगा 
У  меня есть словарь  यहां словарь  subject है यहां subject fixed है इसीलिए object  change नहीं हो रहा है चाहे Subject स्त्रीलिंग, पुल्लिंग  या बहुवचन हो हमेशा एक ही form में होगा।
у меня (есть)    -   I have
у тебя (есть)   -   you have
у него (есть)   -   He has
у неё (есть).   -   She has
у нас (есть)  -    we have
у вас, у Вас (есть) -  you have(plural and formal )
у них (есть)   -   They have
Affirmative
Preposition у + pronoun in the Genitive case + есть+ noun in the Nominal case. The verb есть can be omitted.
EXAMPLES: 
У него есть машина. – He has a car.
У меня есть брат. – I have a brother.
У неё серые глаза. – She has grey eyes.
Negative
Preposition у + a pronoun in the Genitive case + нет+ noun in the Genitive case.
EXAMPLES: 
У меня нет времени. – I have no time.
У нас нет денег. – We have no money.
У вас нет компьютера́. – You don’t have a
computer.
Interrogative
Preposition у + a pronoun in the Genitive case + есть* + noun in the Nominal case. The verb естьcan be omitted.
EXAMPLES: 
У тебя есть друзья? – Do you have friends?
У них есть билеты? – Do they have tickets Lesson -7
Point no :- 4  The word order of russian sentence                                                                रशियन वाक्य में शब्द का कर्म : -

👉 Affirmative sentences(  सकारात्मक वाक्य में शब्द कर्म  ) :-  सकारात्मक वाक्य में आमतौर पर Subject (कर्त्ता) predicate  के पहले आता है predicate का मतलब Subject (कर्त्ता) के बाद जो कुछ भी आएगा वह predicate होगा ।
 उदाहरण:-   I  eat mango.  यहां I Subject (कर्त्ता) है और  इसमें eat mango  predicate  है ।
Том читает.  Том  is sub and predicate  Is читает. 

👉 आमतौर पर (adverbs of manner ) रीतिवाचक क्रिया विशेषण (verb) क्रिया के पहले होता है।
 उदाहरण:- том  хорошо  читаем. 
 यहां том is subject,  хорошо is adverbs of manner, and читаеть is verb with -em conjugation.
👉  प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में शब्द कर्म बिना प्रश्नवाचक शब्द का (sentence order in interrogative sentence without question word):-     
 प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य ( interrogative sentence) में शब्द कर्म (word order) जिसमें प्रश्नवाचक शब्द (interrogative word – как ,где, что,кто  नहीं हो उसको हम सकारात्मक वाक्य के तरह ही सजाते हैं  और प्रश्न को हम  केवल स्वर उच्चारण के द्वारा प्रकट करते हैं
 उदाहरण :-  बाजार जाओगे? खाना खाओगे? इस वाक्य में जाओगे खाओगे के ऊपर ज्यादा दबाव पड़ रहा है या जाओगे खाओगे का आवाज बाजार और खाना से ज्यादा ऊंचा है जिससे यह पता चलता है कि यहां पर प्रश्न पूछा जा रहा है ठीक उसी तरह रशियन भाषा में हम लोग केवल स्वर उच्चारण के द्वारा प्रश्न को प्रकट करते हैं यदि उसमें प्रश्नवाचक शब्द नहीं हो।
 उदाहरण:- том читает?  इस वाक्य में कोई  प्रश्नवाचक शब्द  नहीं है प्रश्नवाचक शब्द का मतलब (как,где,что,,кто).
Том работает? यहां पर भी प्रश्नवाचक शब्द नहीं है।
👉 प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में शब्द कर्म जिसमें  प्रश्नवाचक शब्द हो (sentence order in interrogative sentence with question word):-     
 प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य  (interrogative sentence ) में शब्द कर्म(word order) जिसमें प्रश्नवाचक शब्द(interrogative word)  भी शामिल हो आमतौर पर यह सकारात्मक वाक्य(affirmative sentence) से अलग होता है यदि उसमें कर्त्ता(subject) एक संज्ञा हो।
 उदाहरण:- что делает том?   Or  что  том делает?
                Как читает Эмма? Or  kak эмма читает?
 यहां subject(Том,Эмма) interrogative word के बाद  आया है और verb के बाद भी आया है दोनों ही रूप सही है आप कैसे भी बोल सकते हैं।
👉 और यदि subject (personal pronoun) हो तो इसमें शब्द कर्म(word order) नहीं बदलता है  और प्रश्नवाचक शब्द(interrogative sentence) के बाद personal pronoun(он,оно,она....) आएगा।
 उदाहरण:- что он делает?  यहां он  interrogative word के बाद आया है और हमेशा interrogative word  के बाद में और उसके साथ  ही personal  pronoun  आएगा।
Как она читает?

Point no -6  Adverb of manner रीतिवाचक क्रिया विशेषण
वे शब्द जो क्रिया का माप (मात्रा) देते हैं उन्हें Adverbs of manner  कहा जाता है। हिंदी में हम इसे 9 भागों में बांटते हैं जो हमें क्रिया करने का तरीका बताते हैं।
1. विधि वाचक (Method) 
e.g. धीरे-धीरे (slowly), हाथों हाथ (on hand), सुखपूर्वक (happily), शीघ्र (urgently)
2. निष्चयवाचक (Decisiveness)
e.g. जरूर (sure), नि: सन्देह (without doubt)
3. अनिष्चयवाचक (Indecisiveness)
e.g. अक्सर (occasionally), कदाचित (never), शायद (maybe), संभवत: (possibly) ।
4. हेतु वाचक (Purpose)
e.g. अतएव (at-last), इसलिए (therefore), किस लिए (for what), क्यों (why)
5. निशेधवाचक (Prohibition )e.g. नहीं (no), मत (don’t), न (don’t/no), कभी नहीं (never)
6. प्रष्न वाचक (Interrogative)
e.g. कैसे (how), क्यों (why)
7. स्वीकृतिवाचक (Permission)
e.g. हाँ (yes), जी (yes), सच (truth), बिल्कुल (sure), ठीक (right)
8. अवधारण वाचक (Concept)
e.g. भर (full), तक (up to, by), मात्र (only)
9. आकस्मिकतावाचक (Suddenness) 
e.g. अचानक (suddenly), सहसा (at sudden)
 ज्यादातर अंग्रेजी में Adverbs of manner  शब्द के अंत में  ly होता है जबकि ज्यादातर रशियन में Adverbs of manner  के अंत में o होता है।
Example:-  хорошо ,плохо , быстро,медленно, тихо. .............etc

Point no -7 The conjuction Ho
Conjuction :-    धाराओं या वाक्यों को जोड़ने वाला शब्द या शब्दों का समूह (and, but, although ,because ,when ,if  ,niether.   Etc )  को conjuction  कहते हैं।
Но :- conjuction  ( Но )  का प्रयोग हम वाक्य में बिना не के करते हैं और उसका मतलब But होता है।
 उदाहरण:- 
           Она читает медленно, но  правильно.  
                         का मतलब 
                    She reads slowly but correctly. I learnt this Lesson – 8 

1.The stem and the ending of nouns. 
 संज्ञा का मूल रूप और संज्ञा का अंत्याक्षर :::-
 
👉Masculine  noun :-  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में Consonant लगा हुआ हो वह संज्ञा का मूल रूप होता है इसके अलावा masculine noun  के अंत में soft sign  b  लगा हुआ रहता है वह भी संज्ञा के मूल रूप में आता है।
 उदाहरण:-   Стол,    словарь
👉Feminine noun:-    जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में Vowel  а  और я  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसमें а  और я ending होगा और इसके अलावा feminine noun  में soft sign b  लगा हुआ रहे तो यह  संज्ञा का मूल रूप होता है।
 उदाहरण: -дверь , комната, аудитория  यहां а  और я ending  है।
👉 Neuter noun :-  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में  vowel o और e लगा हुआ रहे तो उसमें o और e ending   होगा।
 उदाहरण:- окно, поле   यहां o  और e ending है।



2.The plural of nouns :- संज्ञा का बहुवचन :- :- 
 संज्ञा का बहुवचन हम तब प्राप्त करते हैं जब हम संज्ञा के मूल रूप  के अंत में vowel  को जोड़ते हैं।
👉Masculine noun:- 
 Point no 1. जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में hard consonant (б , в, г ,д ,ж ,з, й ,к ,л, м,н ,п, р, с ,т ,ф  ,х ,ц ,ш)  रहे तो  उस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में ы  जोड़ते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- студент – студенты
Point no 2.  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में й  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и  लगा देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:-  санаторий – санатории
Point no 3.  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में soft sign b लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и लगा देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- портфель – портфели
Point no 4.  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में г ,к, х , ж ,ш ,ч ,щ  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसके बाद सिर्फ और सिर्फ и  लिखते हैं ।
 उदाहरण:- уро́к- уро́ки ,   каранда́ш- карандаши́


👉 Feminine noun :-  
Point no 1.जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में vowel а  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर ы लिख देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- газета – газеты
Point no 2 . जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में vowel я  लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и लिख देते हैं।
 उदाहरण :- аудитория – аудитории.
Point no 3. जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में soft sign b लगा हुआ रहे तो उसको बदलकर и लगा देते हैं।
 उदाहरण: - дверь – двери
Point no 4 –  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में а  और я  हो और उसके पहले г , к ,х ,ж ,щ ,ч , щ  हो तो а  और я  बदल कर и  लिख देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- кнйга – кнйги.
👉Neuter noun :-  जिस संज्ञा शब्द के अंत में vowel  o  और e  रहे तो  उसको बदलकर а  और я  लिखते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- окно – окна  , поле – поля.
Important point :-  हम लोग जब संज्ञा का बहुवचन बनाते हैं तब  अगर संज्ञा के अंत में и  आ रहा  हो तो उसके पहले soft sign b  नहीं लिखते हैं।
Important point :-  हम लोग जब संज्ञा का बहुवचन बनाते हैं तब तब किसी में stress चेंज होता है और किसी में stress चेंज नहीं होता है  और यह नियम masculine, feminine,  और neuter  तीनों पर लागू होता है।


     
4.   Это  :- это   का अनुवाद जब हम अंग्रेजी में करते हैं तो उसका मतलब This is या These are होता है ।
उदाहरण:- это книга.   This is a book.
                Это книги.  These are books.
5.  .The word order of a russian sentence.  रशियन  वाक्य में शब्द क्रम :  :-
 रशियन भाषा में  समय और स्थान के लिए जो Adverbial modifier (विशेषणात्मक संशोधक) उसको हम हमेशा वाक्य में सबसे पहले लिखते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- утром том завтракает.  Tom has breakfast in the morning.
Дома мы омдыхаем. We rest at home.
Important point:- रशियन भाषा में समय और स्थान के लिए जो Adverbial modifier (विशेषणात्मक संशोधक) आते हैं उसके बाद comma  नहीं लगाते हैं।
Important point :-  प्रश्नवाचक वाक्य में  समय और स्थान के लिए  जो adverbial modifiers  लगाते हैं उसको हम वाक्य के सबसे अंत में लिखते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- что вы делаете вечером?
6.Logical stress:-      रशियन भाषा में वाक्य का शब्दक्रम
बदलता है और यह logical stress के ऊपर निर्भर करता है और जो शब्द logically stressed  होगा उसको वाक्य के अंत में हम लिखेंगे और उसमें शब्द एक सवाल का जवाब है।
 उदाहरण:- кто чита́ет? - читает том.
где чита́ет том? - том чита́ем дома.
когда́ том чита́ем? - том чита́ем у́тром.
как чита́ем том? -  том чита́ем хорошо́.
Very very Important point :-  एक अंग्रेजी वाक्य में There is/There are  की संरचना वाले वाक्य का  रशियन भाषा में जब हम अनुवाद करते हैं तो adverbial  modifier को वाक्य के शुरू में लिखते हैं नहीं तो इसका मतलब पूरी तरह से बदल जाता है।
 उदाहरण:- шкаф сле́ва. The cupboard is on the left. इस  वाक्य में adverbial modifier  को वाक्य के अंत में रखा गया है  जिससे इसका मतलब बदल गया है। इस  वाक्य में stress adverbial modifier  पर पड़ रहा है।
сле́ва шкаф. There is a cupboard on the left. इस वाक्य में adverbial modifier  को वाक्य के  शुरू में रखा गया है  जिससे इसका मतलब बदल गया है। इस  वाक्य में stress  subject  के ऊपर पड़ रहा है।
Note :- тоже  अपने प्रमुख शब्द के पहले आता है  यह ना तो   वाक्य के शुरुआत में आता है और और ना ही वाक्य समाप्त होने के बाद आता है।
 उदाहरण:-  том тоже  студент.
                 Он може  хорошо читает.
7.complete  and short answers:   संपूर्ण और छोटा उत्तर-       
  जैसा कि हम लोग जानते हैं बातचीत में हम लोग संपूर्ण उत्तर और छोटा उत्तर भी देते हैं।
 उदाहरण:- кто он?   -   он студент (complete answer)  – студент(short answer). 
8.вечер ,утра  :- रशियन वाक्य में вечер ,утра  जो प्रकार है उसमें अंग्रेजी के समान कोई सर्वनाम(pronoun) नहीं है।
 उदाहरण:- вечер – It is evening . Вечер  अपने आप में पूरा वाक्य है।
Сейчас утра – It is morning now.

Hi,at first i thought that German is the hardest language but now i'm of the opinion that i made a mistake :) ..your lessons came in useful and go ahead..tnx a lot I thought German is hard but after trying Russian it's very easy :D Для Ы даже транскрипции нет Я из России :) ь ъ 👎 Посмотрела ваш урок и вдруг поняла, что знаю не только русский, но и английский;)) капец, вррде нашь язык легкий, но это не так... я вам помогу с русским а вы помогите с английский мне Всем привет я из России.Передаю всем американцем привет. (Russian) Is there any way to kind of explain how the "r" sound is pronounced in Russian? 

It seems like it doesn't have a true "r" sound as it does in English очень хорошо я сам плохо знаю русскии ну ваш урок меня помогает спасибо Thank you! This really helps with my research.  I am writing a debut novel, historical romance about a Russian countess who in the 1840s goes to London and falls in love with an Indian artist.  There are parts of the book where she speaks to him in Russian and he speaks to her in Hindi, little phrases that they translate for each other, it's a take on an opera. Супер! Спасибо! The first five languages I am studying (other than the one I was born with in this life which was English)   are Русский Язык,  ქართული ენა,   Suomen Kieli,  Ελληνική Γλώσσα,  and Маг1арул Мац1.    The last one Маг1арул Мац1 is the most difficult but I do like Аварский Песни  ( На Аварский = Маг1арул мац1алда = In Avarsky ) songs, so I do consider it necessary to learn the Avar Language so I can translate them.    It is almost impossible to find any material in Avarsky Grammar which is translated into English and that is why I would say it is Level Six  (Exceedingly Difficult), and level 5 is Extremely Difficult.   I would have to admit that is too many languages to study especially at my age but it sure keeps me busy.    I have had lifetimes in at least four of these countries - Russia, საქართვილო ( Грузия ),  Ελλάδα (Greece),  and Дагестан/Dagestan,  but I am not sure of  Suomea /Finland.    Usually by travelling to a country you find out if you have had a lifetime there  (like I did for Грузия = Georgia),  so I do intend to do that if I think I can afford it.    Thank you for your Russian Lessons which I am viewing at present, and thank you also for you Finnish Lessons which I regularly review. Hey I'm a Afrikaans Speaker From South Africa Should i learn Russian Well ? my Friends they are all Russians in Russia and speak English with me " Л" нас учили говорить не "ЭЛ", а "ЭЛЬ", нам в школе за это бал снижали Я ору :DD excellent Только не Лео Толстой, а Лев Толстой)) I  have a friend living in Ulyanovsk who is teaching me Russian as well and she gave me three links to these videos.  I hope they help Hi Anastasia, Thanks so much for the happy Russian lessons.

I want to ask how much similarity is there between Russian and German ? плохо.
Не надо рассказывать иностранцам? какие буквы похожи, какие непохожи.
Они там не дегенераты, сообразят.
Подберите лучше такие слова-примеры, в которых буквы будут максимально чётко произноситься в реальных словах.
Если А - то АНАНАС, МАМА, АВИАЦИЯ
Если Б - то БАРАБАН, БАНАН, БОКАЛ
Сразу П - ПАПА, ПОПУГАЙ, ПУТИН
как-то так.
Все слова им знакомы, но они сразу же услышат наше произношение, без заморочек с транскрипциями для русского языка!

Русский язык - язык ФОНЕТИЧЕСКИЙ, то есть не нуждается в транскрипциях -- _как говорю так и пишу_, не нуждается  в spelling-e i am headback to 2013 now :) (Y)

Obrigado por compartilhar o alfabeto. хорошая программа, вспомнил как изучал Английский в школе. но одна поправка не ЛеО Толстой, а ЛеВ Толстой Hi Anastasia, you're going great job.

One day soon, I will surprise her with something you have taught me.  Hi Anastasia!  I know Russian, but looking for a video to help a friend learn some Russian.  I like the first video, but wish the letters were larger and highlighter as you read them.  If the viewer looses place they may need to start all over? so nice video thanks so much :) Could you outline a method to study and progress every day ?,     Thank you !
                  Daniel а можете ещё видео наснимать-забавно смотреть на выпуклые глаза иностранцев Наверное,бедным иностранцем сложно учить наш Родной Русский язык. уф! даааа !!! thank you for your sharing :)appreciate your video, and you have made it easier for me to plan, to learn Russian language... Good lesson. Anastasia, some letters resemble Greek alphabets. Is Russian language related to Greek language? more videos about russian lession please :) !!! tks you so much !!! Thank you very much! I look forward to your coming videos, I've been interested in Russian language for quite long time and now I thought I could start studying it at least a little bit!
Greetings from Finland!! (: And yes!!! Finally!
I started Russian language lessons! Hurray!
Hats off to those who learn Russian as I know this language is quite a crazy one! :P Wow the russian letters are so confusing! You're doing a great job :D Спасибо Gracias. Very good :)))  Muito obrigada, pelos seus videos.
Eu amo a Rússia.. niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Мы ведь говорим: на море штиль...Я еду на море.... You can help me to translate to :) I've added the links to the texts of the lessons under the video and on the video as well. The English translation of the lesson needs to be corrected. ;) Help!!! Помогите!!! perfect. like them lessons.
one question, where can i find translation of each lesson for my unknown words? Bardzo dobre nagranie,dużo można się nauczuć.   Odlično. These videos are amazing! спасибо! Спасибо большое за ответ. Мне очень нравится ваш канал, Вы делаете очень хорошее дело. Он ушел в море, это так точно говорят. А на картинке он на карабле, за штурвалом, в море, но не в самом море, на море, но не на берегу моря. Это вопрос к Грамота.ру. Они всё знают и говорят, как правильно. Если в Гугл поставите "Аллё на земле и на море", то выйдете на блог учителя русского языка Дырды Натальи Владимировны. Думаю, что так и так можно, смысл немного другой. А для начинающих учить русский "на" подойдёт, когда русский выучат, сами поймут, как правильно и меня обучат :)  А капитан точно "на море"? Не "в море"? Complimenti. Fatto molto bene. большое спасибо. Gracias. @Irlandesaaa There is a rule :) "Это кот. Этот кот милый. Это телефон. Этот телефон дорогой." But "Это книга. Она большая. Это ноты. Эти ноты мои. Это зеркало. Оно круглое." Have a look at WikiTranslate org at the page "Russian cases - Pronouns - Nominative case" @LrtenaL Рада, что смотрите! спасибо мои учительница @Q8yaMal милый котThis was great ❤️❤️😍😍😍😍 This was the most difficult sound for me to learn, thank you! Great video, I have a much better understanding of how to pronouns this difficult sound. Thanks, finally learnt how to say ы (sigh of relief); clear pronunciation and perhaps the looks played the major part. 😯 The T was easy because I'm latin... the Ы is very difficult to master. I know how to say it when I think about it, but it's not yet natural. Very helpful! Thank you! Наталья вы такая серьезная! Улыбаться не преступление So boring So boring FINALLY! For two years I've been trying unsuccessfully  to pronounce this properly and this lesson has it coming from my mouth at least as well as a native speaker. Thank you so much! Epiphanies happen so rarely, and are nearly impossible to share. I can't think of any words that may fully convey this moment. Gorgeous Russian woman... Here is an audiobook about russians https://youtu.be/AiBLap5414c My girlfriend, a Muscovite, agrees with your approach. That you bring up appropriate points,such as, on the hard consonants amount other salient points. It is certainly very helpful. Thank you. Amazing, thank you. Helped me alot The methodical explanations followed by demonstrations are the best I've seen, and I studied Russian both on my own and in classes. Thank-you. Thanks!!!  Very helpful!!! Good mam Thank you very much! It helped a lot. Thank you Natalia. This is by far the best explanation of this sound that I have come across. I really found it to be very helpful indeed. My grandparents came from Russia in 1888. Last name Zbaney, Wish I knew how to pronounce Very helpful, thanks! cyka blyat! can't ya smile! spesiba The problem is not so much making the sound, which isn't so hard when using methods such as those in your video. The challenge is being able to say it naturally in the middle of a word without focusing so much attention on it that you have no chance of doing anything else such as thinking what you are saying or what word comes next! Wonderful! the best explanation I´ve heard of ы. Thank you very much. Still goddamn difficult but this really helps спасибо из Квебека! You were born to teach language. Very helpful, spasibo HARD CONSONANTS?  YOU MEAN ALL OF THEM? I really like the diagrams! I don't hear phoneme nuances, but a picture says a thousand words. I've had someone try to explain this before but no luck. The diagram makes a huge difference! This was very helpful.  I have yet to see the book that can adequately describe this sound without misinforming a student; it must be heard, repeated, and practiced, not just guessed at from someone's opinion of the sound. This video in particular had me subscribe to your channel.  Спасибо! Thank you so much, I can finally pronounce it!)) I've started learning Russian language for almost a week and I care about correct pronunciation in every language i start. I'm really happy to find your channel before entering to this language... Спасибо Наталия! I looove you! thanks for the explanation miss natalia.. spasiba  and your lessons are very helpful as im getting  more into the grammar part of learning russian.. i have meeting with my wifes parents  in august.. your breakdown  of syllables  help tremendous.. again i thank you and  you are a great help.. спасибо You are a great teacher. Thank you! does it sound like oo-we? in english? ы came easily to me. Heard it once, just pronounced it. Still can't roll my R's though. ): Also, women in China would die for skin like yours. This helped ! Thanks! It made me smile and laugh too 

Это помогло! Спасибо! Он сделал меня улыбаться и смеяться слишком ! это мне помогло, особенно часть о жестких согласных. спасибо. really good explanation thanks! 'I wish I could tell you each one of my students mastered it perfectly, but that would not be true..........because the ones that didn't were sent to Siberia ,to be devoured by tigers....' ....*icy cold stare into camera* Interesting, challenging, and great lesson. you are easy to learn from. Is it anything like 'œil' (French for eye)? well we already have â in our language. extremely easy. not hard at all. I am romanian and we have the letter  " î "   wich is very similar actually, and also doesn't have equivalent in any western language and it was relatively simpler to learn that way. For me It was like the sound of " î " + " i "(e in english ) pronounced together. Very helpful video, твой канал золотой рудник. Большое спасибо :D Excellent video -- the pointers on pronouncing ы helped me a lot, especially keeping the tongue as per у but the lips open & throat tightened.  Thanks! Молодца Наталья! Ваше видео очень полезно. Только диаграмы не очень ясны. This is a very helpful video. wow thanks this really helps. excelente! muchas gracias! muy pedagógico y con información detallada y valiosa! Natalia thank you for this lesson, I pretty much had the pronunciation down  before I watched it. Actually we have an expression that is close depending on how people say it, it  is the word yuck  and it 's generally used to describe something that tastes nasty " oo yuck", especially if something tastes bitter ,like you want to vomit...that is about as close as English speakers have to approximating  the bi sound,  I also wanted to thank you for emphasizing proper pronunciation, to speak any language correctly you have to learn the discipline of correct pronunciation and grammar , when we were young my mother was very strict about proper pronunciation and she hated slang , she would stress grammar and proper structure and phrases....most people don't even speak proper English....so thank you for taking the Russian Language seriously in your  teaching presentations Good video, thanks for the time and effort to make it. It indeed helped me to understand the sound better.
Hope this comment won't bother you, but when you mention hard consonants the graphic that shows is of hard and soft vowels, that could confuse some people. Ы is like ill in English? Спасибо, Наталя!  This is a very helpful lesson to pronounce Ы, a very difficult letter!  I will watch this many times and practice. you are very stupid no idea what yu are taking obout 1000 LOLs Wow! Thanks. The tightening of the throat was the last piece I was missing. What a difference it makes! Much appreciated. I found this to be very helpful. Amusingly, this is actually close to the sound I tend to make when I'm exasperated with something. This was very helpful. Thank you, this is really helpful! I have one question, though. You claim that it's not possible to pronounce и after a hard consonant. I'm wondering if this applies mainly to English speakers only. I'm a native Finn and we have the hard consonants in Finnish, too. However, I find no trouble pronouncing и (our "i") after a hard consonant. ы=uoy? great love to learn russian menya zavot sangeen e pakistana kak dela Spaceba, nice lesson.. I'm an English teacherfrom America living in Japan, and I know teaching a language isn't easy, so I really appreciate your effort. You are a very good teacher, Thanks for that, confusing but I'll get it, If you see this Thanks Thalwen!!! I found this really helpful, now to make my tongue and lips obey and one go in directioun of /u/ and other in in direction of /i/ :) Thanks a lot! Thank you so much . Advice on tongue placement and throat muscles made learning how to say ы much less complicated . You could improve your pronounciation of english "one", "with", "wish" etc. You are amazing! 
Thanks so much Very helpful Natalia - this was extremely helpful. I just finished my first lesson in Russian and had a great deal of trouble with this one. However, after your video, I feel like I am beginning to make progress. she's so beautiful This is the learning resource I was looking for. Already subscribed to the channel. You're a great teacher! I have watched a lot of videos online about Russian Pronunciation and yours is the most detailed and informative video I have found, After watching your video and practising I am now able to pronounce the right  "Ы" sound, thank you!! So clear, precise and helpful. Brilliant. That was really helpful, thank you ! It's helpful not only for Russian but for other languages that have similar sounds as well. Finally I got it! :-D Спасибо за ваши видео, они очень познавательны и интересны, но букву -Ы-, разве сложно выговорить? Excellent lesson!!! Thank you! This was quite helpful to me! I think part of my problem is that I am not pronouncing the hard consonants hard enough. It is a lot more natural to say Ы once I get the consonant right. It helps to already know the pronunciation of Swedish, English, Irish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and French Just try to imitate Popeye laughing and notice where your tongue goes :p Very helpful, thank you! You've got teaching this sound down to a T, or should I say down to a ы!
As soon as I made the oo sound my tongue was in the right place for ы, perfect thanks so much i like that you go in depth with pretty much every single detail, i feel a lot of other peoples videos are rushed through. Thank you very much, it was indeed very helpful, especially comparing the sounds! "Ы is a sound 'ich has no English ekvivalent. It is van of ze most difficult sounds for non-native spiikers"
I love the Eastern European accents so, so very much. This video has just helped me a lot, Thank you very much! yay, mastered it wow this video was so helpful !!! thank you for your help. not confusing.very, very helpful. This was extremely useful. Thanks for your time to make this video. This is a very good video, especially the diagram of the tongue position.  The words you teach in your video are helpful.  However, I'm still having difficultly with words that have ы but begin with the 's' sound, like сыр и сын.  Would the pronunciation techniques in your video work the same with these two words? Thanks. Здравствуйте everyone. But thanks for this amazing video. I have been learning foreign languages for quite a while, and this one darn letter, Ы, has to be one of the hardest struggles that a language speaker will ever face. But your careful guidance, I mastered the letter within the first three minutes! Thank you, thank you so much for this help. +1 subscriber, too. Sound is too bad. Can't learn from this. Thanks this is the best explanation of the ы  sound. I was really confused for a few days as to how to pronounce it you did an amazing job of explaining it! Your video helped me a lot on the pronunciation of this letter. Thank you! :) спасибо большое!Thank you 🤣🙏🤩😍❤ a  ya  xochu vopros  zadavac  moy papa  ili moya  papa  papa  na bukvu a  zakanchivayet  zachem moy  spasiba, eta kharasho ;-)  shype

 good family.. :)  good family.. :)  you are great,,
love you three @Q8yaMal You have asked very good questions! @Q8yaMal There is no meaning, it is mostly used to show surprise and/or other emotions. Russians have lots of emotions (I do) and use it a lot!

-Что это?

-Что это?

-Что же это?!!! 
(I want to say something new, but the question is the same!) @Q8yaMal They are "Aspectual pairs". I will make lessons about them later.Love it 1:58 Hm, so mom and dad changed their genders, didn't they? Cousin Eddie from "Christmas Vacation" 😂🤣😂😂 The anglicised approximation at the bottom errs in not devoicing final consonants. for example, in супруг (spouse)  the final Г is devoiced,   supruk, not suprug. the russian voice does this correctly Русский язык очень хорошо язык Замечательный тест You produce great lessons. I am Greek and I am trying to learn the Russian language!I practice my English the same time.thank you, spasiba, ευχαριστώ! The daddy. Lol!!! 😂 Nice, clear presentation and the right kind of voice.

Sorry if I'm not making sense.  Izvinitye. Amazing 🤩 Très utile, merci! Very useful, thanks !очень полезно спасибо! This is rhe best This is an amazing  video!! Hi. I’m an English person and on month 10 of learning Russian. I’ve just fallen upon thus video. It has been EXCELLENT for practicing correct pronunciation. Very well designed. Thank you. I’ve subscribed. how can I get this with pdf version. thank you so much for this useful video. Perfect Thanks a lot from Egypt Thank you Kristina. This is a wonderful class for me as a Russian learning student. This video gave me an idea how to teach Japanese, as well. So fantastic. Your teaching style is fun, easy to understand and not fast, great for beginners who are just learning Russian❤️❤️🙏🙏 I don't like this way of learning.  The russian words are not translated, so you cannot memorise words, which you can use in other phrases. I am starving -in the original is -I (will) die of hunger. These two important words remain hidden behind the translation.
. Dear teacher,

I would like to thank you a lot for your efforts in making these videos. I have subscribed to many Russian learning channels, and all of them are good, but I can say that this teaching style ( repeating, with visual russian subtitles) is the MOST efficient for me. thank you ! Most important phrase in any language 23:55  Thank you so much for your resources! More videos like this please! I love these slow Russian videos. It helps me to clearly hear the entire pronunciation of each word.  Thank you so much! Спасибо большое I like all your videos, really good job ...Thumb up 👍👍👍👍 Thanks Thaaank yoooouuuu Why can't I make the sounds that are coming out of her mouth? It's like my mouth is broken. I can't even mimic some of the things she says. But I'm not giving up! Very helpful video. Some cartoons that carry easy words for me to understand and practice them every day will be more than welcome. I have nobody to speak with in russian, and as a beginner , it would be good if I can hear simple conversation with simple words I learned so far. Thank you very much A lot of these sentences use "ты" (informal) instead of "вы" (formal/ plural). If you're a beginning learner of Russian, and don't really know any Russians ,wouldn't you more than likely be using the formal form of "you"? Thank you so much for this lesson
Спасибо за всё✍✍ Russian is my fourth language, and you made me lovin it, less than a month following your channel and I’m doing good 非常感谢 Gracias subir este video.
Aprendi mucho. ☺ 👍 Thanks for another great video. "For me personally", I was not able to work out / comprehend with a few of the (m)(f) phrases if the (m)(f) were referring to the person "saying" the phrase or the person that the phrase was said "to"   Some were OK but others confused me. 


Also, the 100 was a lot            When I tried to go back over it a few times, I was not able to remember them as the gap between first hearing it and hearing it a second  /  3rd  /  4th   time though, was still too much. 


But that is only me, I am a slow learner. I would have loved 20 instead of 100. So, I did 20 then returned to the start then did that a few times and it worked better. Then from 21 to 40, then 41 to 60, then 61 to 80, then 81 to 100. These smaller units were better "for me"   


I have not said that as criticism but to show how the number of 100 can be manipulated to 5 groups of 20. 


But then again, that would have given you "5" separate videos. )))  


I don't know how the youtube payment thing works but hey, if 5 shorter videos gives you more money then great  )))  but if 1 longer video gives you more  then cool  )))
Bottom line. Thanks for another great video I love it, give me more...!!!
The best ...
That’s how to teach and learn Russian..
For a binder like me... O DISLIKES!!!!!! AMAZING! GOD BLESS YOU))) Кристина ты самая лучшая :) I like your video very much and listen to them all the time.  If you can make some videos with one time in English first then 3 times in Russian that will help a lot when I am in bed learning it without looking at the screen.  For daytime learning it is better to have bigger word font size.   Thank you so much for the slow Russian. Your voice and pronunciation is beautiful.  I will expecting a lot more better videos. This was very helpful! You have a beautiful voice:) Thanks for making videos! очень хороший урок Hi Kristina, I’ve tried to download your programs and I cannot? Is it not possible to do this with an iPhone? think you...bravo Dear Teacher
I have found your your channel on Febrary 22 2020 pm.
I like your videos very much because repeating three times very suitable for beginners who learn Russian language.
Thank a lot.
Regards Wow fantastic I've looking for this translation thanks for this I really like this type of video.  Спасибо! Ваше видео очень полезно. Болшое спасибо. Excellent ! We need more like this. Thank you очень хороший урок I like the shorter sentences. I can memorize them faster, while concentrating on each point of grammar. Thank you. thank you so much!! Spacibo, 

I love your videos I love your books. Glad to find out you have a channel ! Absolutely loved this video! Thanks so much! большое спасибо! я научился говорить «ты сводишь меня с ума». Информационное видео😘 Спасибо тебе за это! 
Кстати, мне кажется, что во фразе «все готово» - ударение должно быть показано на втором слоге: готOво Спасибо большое! ❤️ Мне нужно пойти ? Correct or ? Thank you so much for uploading this!💗Subscribe to Anastasia's channel💗 – http://youtube.com/AnastasiSemina There is also an A2 version of Tochka now. Significantly better than Golosa and Assimil. It’s more of an exercise focused version of berlitz courses, but def similar so clearly written for European audience. If you don’t wanna use PayPal to order from authors, it is available on Ruslania as well. I use toshka ru and it is so good. The book is really helping but it is really fast based Are any of these books good for the English speaker who nothing about the language? The reason I ask is that these books look like they are entirely written in Russian Beginners will not understand She is reading  nicely but very fast bruhhh I am so glad that I discovered that this video has subtitles lol I wasnt a understanding anything while wondering why is she talking fully in russian a video to beginners I'm learning Russian, i started two days ago. Check what i can say

Я ем Русский
Lol - Why...
Why did i comment this Матрешка на учебники🤣 Я настоящий Русский живу в Краснодаре можете задать вопрос Where  can  i buy  these  books? You  didn't  put  the website  link below! Please. Hey how can I contact with you Hi & thnks for the recomendations :) Can you please tell me if точка.ру comes with the solutions for the exercises? Thanks a lot in advance! Две красивые женщины-учителя, профессиональные поцелуи и объятия.😘❤😍🌷⚘ Why would you create a video about beginner books for a new language and speak in the language they have not learned yet. These ladies are the top dogs in teaching Russian ! 😜 Thanks for the tip about Точка.ру. Since I am in Switzerland and the authors live here, it is the perfect solution.

Can you or someone recommend a forum to gather general information about travel in Russia? I am planning an extensive overland trip (slow travel with my own vehicle) and will need to know lots of things in advance (for example "how is the cell phone coverage outside cities?") good Is the workbook required or is it optional with the student's book? Also, is there any English in this textbook or is it all in Russian? I speak a slavic language already (serbian) so i know a good amount already, most of the alphabet too! I cant wait to learn russian, its SUCH a beautiful language!! Hello. Thank you so much for your recommendation about the books. Where can I find or rather buy them? Is there anyway to get the answers?? Thank you for your opinions. I am starting from scratch and have been looking for textbooks and this video has helped me. 🙏🏾 Why not just sell it in the UK on amazon? Hi there, can we buy the Точка books somewhere please? I live in Louisiana. I had a lot of French courses in school. I've been watching Olena and the jaw harp and Tribal Dance Company. I have a question. I love books, printed books. Here, in America, the younger generation only wants to read on the computer. I still love printed books. How do Russians feel? I hope you can still love printed books too!!! Have a great day. I am curious about Tochka Ru. I am self-studying Russian though. Anyone that has used that book, is it user-friendly enough to be used on your own? i.e. outside of a classroom setting? Well looks like I'll be hittin up Barnes & Noble. Time to get me some Russian speaking learning books. Hi, I'm interesting in learn this language, but I'm Mexican user, so What do you recommend me to reach it? Are there any books for hispanic users? Thanks. Your language is beautiful. :D Anastasia,??  The (unfeeling) medicine??🙄🙄 спасибо за познавательную беседу. Узнала о новых  классных учебниках. Когда будет продолжение? Анастасия здравствуйте!
Меня зовут Ирина, живу в Америке, попросили заниматься с ребенком 10 лет русским языком, гречанка американского происхождения.
Какой учебник посоветуете, что называется с ноля.
Еще хотелось бы знать ваше мнение по поводу дистанционного курса РКИ предлагаемого  Международным центром русского как иностранного языка.Хоть русским я и владею, но с чего начинать и как учить представляется мне проблемой.
Есть ли teacher's book для учебников Точкару и Сувенир?
Очень прошу вас помочь в выборе.
Спасибо огромное заранее.
Ирина Are the books that are meant for teaching Russian kids that you could suggest? Great video! I have Tochka ru books but not the audio. Where can I get just the audio? I need it :( Daria you're so beautiful I wish you would have more children. How can I get them if I live in Mexico? Thank you ladies and uploader/support 😊👍 Russian women are beautiful!! Tochka Ru book is very interesting. Hi I am from India I want to learn Russian I have no idea about the language. Plz recommend me a book Hello!! Thanks for advertising great textbooks. Where can I buy them? I live in Missouri, mid-America, U.S.A. Thanks so much. а когда русский бренд "красивые девушки"? Two of the best teachers. قناتك رائعة وتبسط التعلم انا املا بها عقلي الباطن شكرا لك داريا :) I use Годоса which is a very beginners textbook. I'm not incredibly far in yet as I've only started two weeks ago, but it seem fairly sold. I also have a Russian instructor guiding the class through the book which is also very helpful. looking forward to watch the other part of the video !!! Good job On the other hand my native language Urdu Ma'am I stand 0 . how I can learn English G'day! I'm not looking to learn a lot Russian but only need a little bit of translation. How do you subtly ask a girl 'Do you want to fuck?' in Russian? Also how to follow that with 'I promise it's not herpes, only a birth mark'?

Cheers from Australia! Can I buy these books if I live in the US? ХОЧУ ПОКУПАТЬ КНИГУ :) Девочки, Ну что же вы авторов не называете? - а так  - большое спасибо! Мне нравится, что вы на кухне. Самое важное место в русской квартире :-) Спасибо девочки ! Есть все книжки , кроме Tochka.ru. I've been learning Russian phrases and words through an audio teaching program, but more recently I've changed my learning style and have been trying to learn practicing with native Russian speakers online, and I'm quickly discovering that I don't know how to alter verbs!!! Specifically how they change when you're referring to different subjects, tenses, etc. So I started reading a recommended Russian teaching book that's all about verbs but oh my gosh it's so boring. Conjugated, Infinite, third person past tense, one-stem method, two-stem method. YAWN!!! I feel like my passion for learning is being drained with all these rules. Is there a better way to learn Russian verb alterations naturally, or do I just need to suck it up and get through learning all the rules and grammar of it in my boring textbook? The one I have is called the "Silver Book of Russian Verbs" or something like that. Maybe there are better ones out there that are more... engaging? Greetings! Thanks for your teaching. Sorry I speak very, very little Russian and understand almost nothing. Do you know what bookstores in America might sell or can order those textbooks? I live in state of Missouri. I guess I will have to visit 2 stores here in town of Springfield. Maybe books are only sold in Russia. I am beginner student. If you don't know, thanks anyway. Have a great day. Hello from the states one question please, how do you turn on subtitles? Iam watching on utube.
Thank you Mary Молодцы! Мне бы тоже к вам, красавицам! А может вы к нам? thank you , nice teachers :-) Привет, спасибо за видео, рекомендации учебники очень полезны, но не могли бы вы, пожалуйста, рекомендовать любые русские книги, чтобы прочитать? Я имею в виду, выпускные книги по уровню   и где их найти. Спасибо. Пока Thanks!. After case grammar and verb aspects one of the biggest challenges in Russian is the vocabulary. I know there are "frequency dictionaries" where you can see 1000  most common words, most common 2000, etc. I would love to see readers set to specific levels. One level reader would have only first 1000 words,(first 500 etc) next level would have only top 2000 etc. Also, if you have ideas for any "e books" (Kindle,  and ibook in USA) that would be great . Here you can get the added help of a dictionary (click on the word and get a definition or at least you can copy and paste to something like Google translate). Keep up the good work! Hi I'm coming to Moscow in December,  can you let me know where I can buy these books in Moscow please? Thank you for these videos ;-)💥WANT TO START to SPEAK RUSSIAN FAST???💥

This was easy to understand, and I appreciate hearing you say each form so that I can try to repeat exactly as you said it. Also, "него" was causing me trouble, so it was really great that you pointed out the unexpected pronunciation. Spaciba bolshoe 🙏🏻🇮🇳 Very good. I have struggled to find the system with these and here it is Where should I put есть in "Сколько у тебя машин? "? Google translated it like that. Cars are something belong to us so we must use it here don't we? Понятно,Благодарю вас ..желаю вам удачи до свиданя и спокоиноии ночи I love your tutorials. Of course, it doesn't hurt that you are very easy on the eyes. Спосибо I am on chapter 9 of the text book тройка and just got introduced to the word уметь. Funny ending to your video. You are awesome.  Я в 9 главе учебника <<тройки>> и только что познакомился со словом уметь. Смешное окончание вашего видео. Ты обалденный. Thank you, as always!  It’s nice to have all of the clarifications I needed to not only understand how to use the verb есть but also when and how to use the verb иметь  Cпасибо большое! i was closer to give the russian up and this video came for me, looks easier with the explanation, you are a very good teatcher! спасибо Your voice is  disturbing thnķs. Wonderful russian teacher. Thank you. RU-LAND CLUB - thank you for this lesson!  Stupid question, why yest?'  Yest is eat?  Is this a different form invented precisely because Russian does NOT have "to have," only the (formal as you described) 'possess?'

Pardon my ignorant question. Я люблю тебя!! 
From in Indonesian Wow🤔😍 Thank you very much for the help and I can’t wait to start speaking this beautiful language All the things I wanted to know and now are really clear  - perfect. Thank you Да у меня есть компьютер спасибо! Hallo i am Portugal,  guten Abend wie geht es dir? Du bist sehr sehr wünderschön frau ❤ ich liebe dich ❤ I thought that Russian doesn't have "have". Like my text book says "Y Ivan ectb dacha", says 'By Ivan there is a cottage'. We think 'Ivan has a cottage'. Nice lesson. The best. 
I recomend and lesson russian with Nastya. Also very useful. I am using both and improve a lot my knowledge Keep shooting these videos. She's a great teacher :) Хорошее видео! Очень полезно.

Brazilian here. Five years ago I would have said this was a good video, but now I see how videos just like this have kept me more confused. The fact is that the phrase "I have" does not exist in Russian language and should not be taught as though it does. You can't just keep memorizing phrases in Russian without any understanding of what is really being said or how people think in Russian. I don't mind watching the video but I have to fix the translation in my mind. I didn't give a thumbs down, but come back after you learn Russian better and you will understand why others also do not like this. Thanks, lady. Please how to say then I will have , you will have ..and I had , you had ? thanks How can Get your first class? Amazing way of teaching....thanks mmmmm BABY; WAnna talk? Thanks a lot Thank you🙏 One more video about the verb "have" in Russian: when to omit the verb ЕСТЬ (in any tense) and what's the difference between "I have" and "У меня есть": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbwmEMnSBNY&t=799s 
Welcome to watch! :) I'm still a little confused about when to omit есть.  It seems that if you have an adjective in front of the noun, then you should omit есть.  So,  у меня красная машина, not  у меня есть красная машина.   Is this correct?  Are there any other reasons to omit  есть? I always love your videos . 😙😙😙 god! what an astonishing beauty of rusian girls !i was in moscow for 3 monhts but didint meet such a perfect cute comited girl as u ,most girls are alone and dont want to get involved with foreigners, a pity! it was one of my dreams but just diidnt hapen, otherwise i would have risked staying there more time -considering legal issues- cause i coudnt get a job or a studioflat either but wow, what a halucinatory and pretty place it is! i really miss it and sufer my not-so-good luck there! o life!

It will a, take you out of "Russian mode" and, b, reduces your exposure to the letters and their sounds Great video and even better channel! But you missed one significant point I used successfully when starting to learn this language. You mentioned there are hundreds of foreign words. I had to collect them before your channel existed by myself but it was worth it. I practiced writing them and after that the language was way way easier to learn. But I didn't treat the foreign words just as a huge group but divided them to smaller ones...foreign words containing only: 1) AKMOT characters, 2) AKMOT characters + having counterparts in English but looks different: b - б and so on, 3) first + second group characters + for example remaining s characters, etc. ХОТДОГ М: лодка don't speak English Nice ❤️ I follow  u and i follow every word u speak about 🥰😀 i did in  2 session To learn Russian alphabet you can use Google Translate.

no offense, it sounds like sneezing! Thanks Natalia for today's spoonful!Q¹1 👍 I like it! Best wishes for u Super 💓 رائع 👍 HiDid russian language or week names not exist before Christ ? Why is then Sunday named after Christ's resurrection? spasiba kharasho. You got blue eyes... amazing Is it true that russians eat potatoes?! Thanks a lot Natalia it was very nice ...God Bless your efforts. 1.NUMARA.BU.BEBEK.MEHMET ALİ ALPDOĞAN. 😍😍😍😍😍😍... you are beautiful every day of the week from what I see ! 

“Spasibo”
for the video Reminds me of the woman from resident evil Hi!
Please upload more videos. Thanks This is a one of the best video. 👍 ou are one beautiful Russian lady...and a great teacher. Thanks for breaking down new words good Russian lessons Great thanks! Хорошо Спасибо большое 😊✨ To my dear Natalia,

Thank you for explaining the origin of the days of the week, in Russian. Спасибо  for saying the words slowly I very agree with your method, but I need to tell that mechanic need to "see" (imagine to undersand) the fonction (attribution) of each part, each piece of a motor to correctly rebuilt it. We need to observe not only the "thing", but also the fonction (onction of each part. for instance injection system : imagine the way... from the beginner (entrance, induction) to the abduction). Russian language is very very very "fonctionnal"... it's a real pleasure to listen your "symphonic" voice, it's easier to memorize with you (orchestral conductor). Russian Soul save the deep and best "voice" of each who have "lost" the fondamental "support" (lost "his feet" -balance) . You are so adorable and a good teacher!  Thanks for being awesome. Superb presentation! Your videos are very helpful in learning Russian as beginner. Please continue the good work. Keep it up! Best wishes!!! Thank you for making the words easier to learn Jesus,man isnt she a beauty? same in Arabic, sabit 
means
суббота what a beauty...I watch every one of your lessons from now on... Your presentations are excellent. Congratulations. Very interesting, I really liked your explanation.
Thank you that was awesome! Спасибо! wow, spaciba, I didn't know that, the way the name were related, wow nice Very interisting way to teach and lovely voice, it´s just I need for learn russian language This leason helps to memorise Russian Week Days with some cultrual factors. Большое спасибо! You make learning a pleasure Natalia The additional information on how the names  of the week are derived is excellent .  Well done! Thank you! I am very thankful to you to make Russian language easy you are cute natalia !!! you cute!!! Thank you very much......for not having any accompanying music to "help" us learn!   Thumbs up, Lady. Thank you Natalia, you're a wonderful teacher. hi natasha if i want to learn russian, what do you recommend to be my first step? thank you!!

great videos by the way very useful!! Interesting, Portuguese days are similar, they're numbered until the weekend when Saturday is named after the Sabbath and Sunday after Lord/God. I guess English is the oddball naming days after Norse gods and planets/Roman gods lol. Your method of association makes it much easier to learn this lesson. Thanks again Natalia. you should smile more. Of course Russians don't like to smile much. I love 3 languages..  English, Deutsche, and Russian.. You are one beautiful Russian lady...and a great teacher. Thanks for breaking down new words by syllable. It's very helpful. This video gives me a hard-on!  Great motivation to learn Russian!  
Sorry, I`m just being honest. ;) hi Natalia I just found you on youtube the other day. This is my third video I am watching after watching the numbers video several times and greetings video. I look forward to watching more of your videos and learning to speak Russian to the Russian  children I teach in the nyc tri state area. why is week Nieděla? when nie dělat means not work, we have it as Sunday in czech, because we don't work at sunday :D others are same, and yea week is týden Thank you, I appreciate when the etymology of the word is given! I like the way that you speak English,it sounds really good,i like your lessons,i want to learn some,you bring a whole new meaning to the word elucidate,excellent, I think you've made the best video here of the Russian names for the days of the week by explaining their semantic origins. This makes it much easier to remember them. Bravo! i like russian language,russian counts are similar yo indian sanskrit counting I want to marry you! i dont know if i chould learn or see to your beautiful face Добавила урок на эту страничку 					http://w-t.me/Russian-DaysOfTheWeek-1 и в плейлист на эту

Excellent!  Very thorough presentation!  Thank you!The Study System that Will Unlock Your Potential to Master Any Language: https://www.lucalampariello.com/free-3-video-training/ I can speak Polish & Russian.. but I try not to mix two languages  due to similarites of 2 languages. брательник Кушанашвили I know it's an old video, but i'm hoping you still see the comment. 
Did you use your bi-directional translation method to learn Russian? 
And how did you write those? Cursive (handwriting), or was it the digital (block letters) that you mainly used or maybe both...?

Thanks! Up next: “How to Navigate Life as a Blind Person - a Visual Tutorial” молодец. я тоже начинает изучать русский язык один месяц назад. не очень трудно совсем. ты крутой !!!! Супер!!! Смотрю это видео, чтобы понять до какого уровня в глазах иностранцев можно дорасти, изучая английский язык. И я скажу вот что! Я поражён! Очень круто и впечатляюще! Меня такие видео мотивируют и заряжают учить и совершенствовать английский дальше! Luca, your Russian is unbelievable! 
I'm a native Russian speaker by myself. I've never seen a foreigner speaking Russian so close to native speakers. 
Amazing work! which resource did you use to refine speaking skills? Sei bravo!!! Parli russo perfetto!!!!!! Чел похвально что ты выуччил наш язык, но мне лично кажется что русский нахер никому не нужный язык лучше знать английский и по этой причине я начал учить ваш язык, англ нужнее чем русский так что don't learn Russian Not bad, not bad at all. Your Russian sounds amazing! Well done! Как здорово! 👏 Отличные советы! а ты реально хорошо говоришь. Я - носитель, подтверждаю это :) Шпионом пока не сможете работать (сразу вычислят) 😀, но если так выучили язык с нуля, то это феноменальный результат! Вы такой молодец! Как native speaker(забыла, как это сказать по-русски🙈) со всей уверенностью говорю, что ваш акцент почти не заметен, и это круто! Восхищаюсь Вами! Вы даёте мне мотивацию изучать другие языки, спасибо Вам большое за Ваш труд❤️ Luca супер я восхищена твоими умением учить языки! Смотрю сейчас на канале в основном ролики на английском про изучение языков вообще, потому как сейчас в данный момент пытаюсь учить ангилийский и французский. Мысль, про то, что два языка учить одновременно, так себе идея, я уже уяснил до этого. Просто вспомнил как на канале virginia beowulf был ролик, про то что "почему ты никогда не заговоришь как носитель" и приведены были примеры Луки и еще какого-то словака. К чему это я. Поискал на данном канале ролики по слову Russian, посмотрел сначала какое-то видео 2013го года, по ролику видно было, что Луке тяжеловато говорить по-русски, и часть слов звучало с акцентом, и с будущим временем там были проколы, но некоторые слова даже тогда звучали прям как из уст носителя. Но это видео прям отпад после того :) Может я все же когда-нибудь выучу английский для начала. :) Вау! Я очень впечатлен вашим уровнем владения русским языком! Это супер просто, как будто вы носитель а не иностранец Я понимал это видео ааааааа :))))))) Превосходно, за всю речь услышал только одну ошибку на 3:28. I found the Cyrillic keyboard quite easy, actually, when I posted a copy of the keyboard viewer handy to my screen. Then as I found the letter and typed it (without looking at the keyboard; I'm a touch-typer), I also sounded out the word. That way I became more familiar with both the typing and the sounds of the letters. Yes, it may be slower at the beginning, but the arrangement of the keys is so much easier to use that I soon caught up. Good Russian...Almost without an accent... Thanks a lot for kind words... Petits conseils pour améliorer ta prononciation russe : le я dans язык ou языковой se prononce comme йи, et en plus court. Quand le son а (que ce soit o ou a, par exemple dans гОворить ou зАмечательно) est éloigné de deux syllabes, il se prononce comme un schwa. D’ordre général, l’accent d’intensité doit être un peu plus marqué, et surtout plus long − ce n’est pas pour rien que le phénomène de réduction consonantique est si marqué en russe, ça dénote une grande intensité sur l’accent tonique et donc une attention moindre aux autres sons des mots. 
Ne prends pas mal ces remarques, simplement comme je sais que tu es un perfectionniste je pense qu’elles te seront utiles ;) You look like a Russian when speaking Russian. Why u all guy want to learn Russian ?) I wanna learn Greek and Russian they are really beautiful languages У тебя охуенный акцент, извини за выражение ❤️ ciao mi sto avvicinando allo studio del russo, a parte che trovo incredibile la velocità con cui riesci a parlarlo 😲 sono impressionata. Non so se mai riusciró a raggiungere questo livello, comunque 
trovo veramente difficile ricordare il significato delle parole, alcune sono molto simili tra loro e oltre ad essere difficili da pronunciare le trovo a volte impossibili da ricordare. 
Cerco creare delle situazioni reali per associarle all’evento ma mi torna tutto complicato. 
Ho studiato inglese e francese e lì qualche appiglio ce l’avevo con il russo mi sento incapace. 
Qualche consiglio specifico provenendo dall’italiano? una dritta ? 🥴 Tak klawiatura fonetyczna w jezyku rosyjskim jest bardzo wygodna potwierdzam 😀 Вы говорите даже лучше чем некоторые билингвы. Как?! Unglaublich, du sprichst echt alles o_O Ich bin deutscher Muttersprachler und lerne seit zwei Jahren russisch, finde es aber wirklich schwierig Лука, ты просто красавчик! Вдохновляешь каждый раз! Спасибо тебе огромное! Unfortunately learning russian for ww2 gives you mostly anti-german propaganda У меня у одного на превьюшке флаг Нидерландов, а не России?) Now Polish please 😁 I've been studying Russian for about 4 months now with no one to talk to. I do have some good progress though but feel like I can prosper more with a native speaker to help me more. Someday I hope I find one 🙏 👍👍❤️❤️👍 If it's for beginners then shouldn't the video be in English. If we are still beginners how do we understand. Your Russian accent is just amazing! Hi Luca, Believe it or not I prefer to use the Russian keyboard which is has the difficult layout when I type in Russian,  Or the similarities would overlap and that would make it confusing. And I am comfortable doing it like this. Мой первый язык Румынский второй Русский третий английский 
Толком я Рузский не учил он в стране как второй язык 😅 I hope to learn russian one day(after I get better at other languages first that are more of use to me on a day to day basis) , since my grandpa speaks it. It would be nice to watch russian movies with him and talk about them with him in russian Your pronunciation is already close to native, but here are a few tips on how you can improve even further:

- Ш and Ж are actually always hard instead of always soft, which is how you currently pronounce them. I'd say these two consonants are your biggest weakness right now.
- Similarly to the first point, ч and, by extension, щ are also always soft - which goes in stark contrast to Polish, so bear that in mind. Ч should be pronunced similarly to Polish ć, while to pronounce щ, you just merge ш and ч together.
- As much as we love to reduce vowels and drop consonants, "у" actually always stays a vowel, and is never pronounced as as semi-vowel ("w"), which is who you currently pronounce it.
Good job, anyway! Произношение  на высшем уровне. Проделана огромная работа. Вы молодец 👍 Я в шоке 😱 у тебя почти нет акцента Браво, Лука! You sound more native in Russian than I do.I have been speaking Russian since I was a baby Гениально I'm not gonna say anything about your accent, because it's almost absent, but your vocabulary is shocking me, you know so many words, it's really surprising it's really amazing Я не видел на ютубе чтоб иностранец так хорошо говорил на русском Buongiorno Luca! C'e' un canale molto interessante sulla storia della Seconda Guerra Mondiale. In russo, naturalmente)) Si chiama "Tactic Media". I storici di guerra parlano ognuno sulla sua tema on livello davvero profundo e competente. Sono i storici chi studiano i documenti in archivi per anni, non quelli "storici" chi hanno letto un paio di libri populari e fanno dopo le lezioni. Se Lei ha un interesse per la tema della WWII, Le raccomando questo canale: https://www.youtube.com/user/redarmychannel/videos Μπράβο σου! Έχεις καλή προφορά. Говоришь очень чисто, почти без акцента. Хороший русский язык. Браво! Grazie tante. Spero un giorno avere il coraggio di provarci. У Вас отличный русский язык!
Вы очень мотивируете изучать языки, спасибо Вам. Привет из России 🇷🇺 Hola Luca, los rusos iban a firmar por secunda vez con los nazis en WW2, pero al final ayudaron. Priviet Я русский и сейчас я занимаюсь изучением английского и немецкого, но мне стало очень интересно, что ты говоришь о русском в этом видео. Translation here. I am russian and now I am learning german and English, though I was curious about this video. I want to know what Luca said about my language. Поздравляю, Лука! Отличная работа! Падежи мы все-таки в школе изучаем. Многие русские еще со времен начальной школы помнят поговорку "Иван Родил Девченку, Велел Тащить Пеленку", которая служит для запоминания названий всех падежей (по первым буквам - И Р Д В Т П).
И еще бывает, что мы неправильно используем падежи. Вот недавно случился скандал с использованием неправильного падежа в бюллетенях для голосования.. Один единственный вопрос не смогли написать без ошибок. Написали слово "Конституция" в неправильном падеже.

Мне понравился твой совет про первоочередность аудирования и чтения. Я тоже считаю, что нужно учиться как дети - сначала как можно больше слушать носителей, и только потом вникать в грамматику. Я таким образом изучаю турецкий, и тоже могу сказать, что логика у этого языка очень необычная. Я-то знаю, зачем смотрю эти видео, но никому не скажу ;) Как же он круто говорит на русском Luca, your Russian is very good, there are some minor errors but очень хорошо! поздравляю тебя! Вы допустили несколько несущественных ошибок, просто не те слова подобрали, мысль ясна, но мы так не говорим. А так, в принципе,  вы говорите так, как будто это ваш родной язык, который вы немного подзабыли, потому что долго жили за границей. Этот язык невероятно сложный как для иностранцев, так и для носителей, даже если всю жизнь его учить. Он гораздо сложнее английского. Падежи это вообще отдельная тема, нужно просто слушать, как их используют носители и просто повторять, никто из носителей их специально не заучивает, как-то само все получается, нам рассказывают о них, когда мы уже научились использовать их в речи. Вы в любом случае молодец, мало кто из иностранцев так говорит, но нет предела совершенству, язык нужно постоянно улучшать и исправлять свои ошибки. Надеюсь, вы поняли, что я написал. Спасибо. Thank you for the video, Luca! I'm casually learning Russian atm, so this comes at the right time. 🙂 My "trick" to learning the keyboard was to just type all vocab and sentences with a chart of the keyboard layout on screen. Did the same thing with Korean. After a while my brain just gave up and commited it all to (eternal muscle) memory. 😁 I have question, though: I've been trying to wrap my head around the Russian "R" - so it's trilled, I get that. But it kind of sounds different from e.g. Italian, maybe more like Bavarian? Am I imagining things? (This is not the first time I'm getting confused... actually, if you could one day make a video comparing all the "R" sounds you've encountered so far, that'd be fantastic!) За сколько Времени Вы достигли такого уровня? Чувак, ты звучишь очень натурально! Очень круто! I'm just starting out learning Russian. I am also learning my first foreign language, Spanish, at the same time. Do you think it's a bad idea when I only just reached B1 in Spanish? To me, they seem different enough that I don't confuse them. Мужик, реальный респект! Звучишь почти без акцента. И лексикон на уровне. Не у всех русских такой уровень лексики Потрясающе! Беглость речи (fluency), ритм, произношение, словарный запас - все на высоте! 
 Excellent! Fantastic job! Luca, I wish I could speak my English, Spanish, Polish and Armenian the way you speak Russian! :) Зачем я это смотрю?) Вы большой молодец! Чувствуется богатый словарный запас и слова все склоняете правильно. Я сейчас одновременно учу японский и корейский и тихо схожу с ума. Очень советую послушать  Linguamus  (Мустафа). Он даже грамотнее говорит на русском, чем большинство русских. А глубина его знания русского языка, будто бездонное. Он знает 13 языков.  Его канал на ютюбе  Linguamus . Он не просто полиглот, а еще лингвист по профессии. Вы потрясающе говорите по-русски! Невероятная работаю I just started last month but I don't know much.  I can't be bothered with the typing on computer (at least yet) so I do it on mobile when I do need to type though I usually prefer using a computer. Some people seemed to talk down on the phonetic keyboard layout, saying that it would not be good for Russian and is kind of like using romanization etc...so I held off. But since Luca does use it and it doesn't seem to hurt his Russian whatsoever, I think I'll just download it. If it's easier, it will only make me want to type in Russian more which is a good thing. Not typing on a French keyboard didn't hurt my French either ;). Вы шикарно говорите по по-русски!) Russian is super hard :( Невероятно приятный человек и скромный к тому же! He didn't make a single mistake in the whole video! And his vocabulary is huge, his level is enough to work as a Russian language/Russian literatury professor in some top-ranked western university. У тебя такая хорошая интонация! Holy... you are a genius. Обожаю, когда иностранцы говорят на моём родном языке настолько круто! Спасибо за видео 🥰🤩 Русский язык довольно сложный, и это очень приятно, что многие иностранцы его учат! Мой родной язык - русский, и я горжусь вами, ребята! I don't speak Russian, I just got the Rssuian Alphabet from Google. I have a book , I found out I need to know the Alphabet first. What advice you have for me. Thank you. Вот это круто, мужик. Очень мотивирующиее видео. Я как носитель русского и украинского языков, сейчас изучаю английский. Огромное уважение!! Luca, sei bravissimo, complimenti! У Вас шикарное произношение! Браво!!!! Очень хороший русский Русский совсем не простой язык и я думаю что оно может быть самой трудной язык Лука, снимаю шляпу. Это потрясающе! Лука, ты крутой! Говоришь лучше многих наших "коренных" жителей. Одно пожелание: не используй обращение на "Ты" в видео. Гораздо гармоничнее будет звучать обращение на "Вы". Удачи! Hi great video! If you’re interested in WW2 I highly recommend you learning polish! There are a lot of books in polish about the history of WW2 and still some people willing to talk about their experiences during the war Русская раскладка - просто кошмар. Хотя у меня уже есть Ц уровень, я до сих пор её не выучил. Всегдa конвертер использую. Ciao Luka! quando farai un video su come imparare il tedesco? Amazing accent. It's almost complete absence to be exact. Being Russian, I dont even speak English with such a good pronunciation even though I am studying abroad right now. HOLY SHIT YOUR ACCENT IS SOOOOO GOOD Лука, ты прекрасно говоришь по-русски, complimenti! Это великолепно, учитывая, что русский, Лука, ты учишь недолго, или я ошибаюсь.السلام عليكم. أريد فيديو عربي روسيThank you for these explanations . Though I find Rule 3 very subtle . Perhaps is it because of my old ears but I can't hear the difference . Couls you write me some more examples please ? Thank you very much . Excelente ensino 🙂👍👍👍👍👍
Belíssimo 🌷🌾🌷🥀🌾🌹⚘ 
 Please visit my channel 🇧🇷🇧🇷⚘ very good explanation! thanks !! well done Natalia you are really such a great Russian Language teaching teacher, please continue doing these videos. Oh my goodness this is the second most helpful site have found on YouTube. Most of the supposedly learning sites are worthless to me. This is so wonderful. Спасибо мой friend. You guys have done a great job. So thankful. I like your english accent your lessons are always helpful!!! Please keep posting new videos, I always look forward to them!!! Your face is as beautiful as your voice mam Очень легко и понятно. why does до sounds /doh/ but in the word до свидания it sounds /da/ ? I've watched lesson #5 about o and a pronunciation  but isn't до a separated word in до свидания?! nice lesson молодец... спасибо Наталья, прошу простить, но Вам также нужно поработать с английским прононсом)  Уроки хорошие, я бы добавил видео с артикуляцией, чтобы было нагляднее. its so easy ,,when you teach the Russian languages....I had brought my books. on beginners for learning the languages but couldn't get through it but now ,, I think I will be able to learn the languages as most of my friends are Russian and I used to translate my messages through Google...but now I can reply on you my teacher ....very much thanks to you... its so easy ,,when you teach the Russian languages....I had brought my books. on beginners for learning the languages but couldn't get through it but now ,, I think I will be able to learn the languages as most of my friends are Russian and I used to translate my messages through Google...but now I can reply on you my teacher ....very much thanks to you... спасибо это было очень полезно! Excellent. Thank you so much for concise and accurate information. Hey, can someone explain me what unstressed and stressed means when she talked about The " o"; "a" . 
English is not my first language, so i didnt really understand that .. 
Thank you in Advanced Thanks so much for your efforts thanks and keep up why is it that Russians pronounce their г like в for example сегодня, Маяковского, etc. I asked my friend this but they couldn't give me a proper answer. When would you know when г sounds like в? I recently started learning Russian with the BBC book.  The female speaker on the audio there speaks way too fast and there is no repetition.  Your approach is so much more useful, as it understands the needs of the learner.  By the way I love your accent when you speak English - I wish you would do some audiobooks!  'War and Peace' read by Natalia would be amazing!! 😊 thank you!!! You're the best teacher in YouTube. I'm a total beginner in Russian. It will be my fourth language. Your lessons are so helpful. You are one of the best teachers on YouTube.
