Your teaching style is way too slow and boring. I only want to see the fun part of your video, when you introduce me with new Russian words. Just stick to the point, don't just go with any flow or get disstracted with any random thought. I watched your whole video and now i feel like, i can explain your video in half of the time that you have taken. Hope you will address that issue, just be quick and full of information. Cut the rubbish out. arhh... it's a pen.. pen... , hurm... My grand grandmother was Russian and I'm from Croatia. She died before I was born, and I never met her. So I wish to learn the Russian in her honor. She's passionate Hello and Hi in Russian just enough to make me give up üòÖ Ithink I'm just learning because honestly I find it a very cool and not so  difficult language as it seems. I love how it sounds too and it feels a bit more confortable to pronounce the words and sentences than some other languages that I was trying to learn lol-

By the way, what is the difference between Xopo—à–∏ y Xopo—à–∏–π?

I learned that –∏ is a vowel, and –π is a consonant.  If –π is like "j" in Josef Stalin, what is difference between i and ij?  They sound exactly alike!

And then, there is Xopo—ào! (a conjugation?) –¢—ã —Ä—É—Å I speak several languages...but everyone wants to speak English only.

You are a very good teacher and a very beautiful woman. Tanks, also for this video. bol'shoye spaseeba As the native Russian speaker myself, I must correct you: that's a kind of meme now to say that in Russian they used to say "Yes no maybe" (Da nyet navyernoye). In fact though that da in the beginning plays the role of say it intensifier, emotional auxiliary senseless word... What "da nyet navernoye" translates to correctly LITERALLY would be like "Well, no, I think". The word da in Russian language has two meanings, at least. For example, look at da in the phrase "Da budyet svyet" - "Let there be light"... –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç,  –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞! –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ BOL'SHOYE SPASEEBA My name is marina to  USA for listening to you Bol'shoye Spaseeba ‚ô• My friend russian: how are you

English: rules for everything 

In my journey in learning another language I'm starting to figure out that the rules for english are very strict compared most other languages. And there are plenty of native english speakers that heavily critique poor grammar. Honestly learning russian for me so far is easier than just communicating in english because my vocabulary sucks and my spieling sucks. (not here because spellcheck) why speaks English so often? Beautiful‚ù§Ô∏è No verb "to be" and no articles? sounds a bit crazy, but suddenly it makes everything easier. at first i was learning korean then i slowly somehow moved on to russian! ty daria —ç—Ç–æ –î–∞—Ä–∏—è,–æ–Ω–∞ —É—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å Who else is trying to learn a language during covid bc u got nothing else to do You r hot medam The weird I is just √º in German. *–ö–æ—Ç –≤–ª–∞–¥–π–º–µ—Ä —å–µ—é—Ç–π—Ñ—É–ª*

Me who uses they/them pronouns : WHYYYY Actually, the English oo has two sounds, long and short. "look" and "book" are short sounds and "loop" and "hoop" are long sounds. The russian y is like the long oo as in loop. The short oo sounds more like oo-eh with the schwa sound at the end. Zhivago honey Actually took Russian but nice refresher. 4:51

Highly appriciate it.
God bless. Thanks goodness for google translate! very enteresting i always watch russiam movies Thanks for that. But I found your presentation a lot more efficient when played at 1.75 percent of normal speed. üòä I felt a touch of Phyrexia when he was talking abou F. y are there so many vowels? I'm Serbian and know all of this but it's fun to watch tbh You missed an important fact, the Russian alphabet is not composed of letters, it is composed of sounds. Where does all this Russian PR come from? About "–®" and "–©" you're a bit wrong, sound you do for 1st letter is correct, but 2nd is not. in russian its totally different letter and they sound different and easily distinguishable. Lets take word "–©–£–ö–ê", if you change the letter and say to any russian speaking this word (e.g. "–®–£–ö–ê") they will more likely think you mean "–°–£–ö–ê" than "–©–£–ö–ê" as it sound actually closer to "–°". This much, "–®" and "–©" are different in sounding. Also if talking about the difference, you actually can prolong sound of "–®" like you know (i dont know how to say it)... you can keep sound "–®–®–®–®–®–®–®–®...", but with "–©" you cannot its short and ends right after it (maybe you can imaging like "ch" and "h", where "hhhhhhh..." is possible to keep sounding, while "ch" is not, its short). TQ will try to acquire Russian language This reminds me of reading sheet music. The symbols can mean to play or sing the music soft or loud. I think the bl sound is what linguists call "schwa". We have the sound in English as an unstressed syllable in words like 'confuse' (1st syllable) or 'cousin' (2nd syllable).  In Turkish it has its own letter; ƒ± (a dotless i). Other posts here have identified other languages where there is a letter or character for the sound. Sorry, I couldn‚Äôt get past A. 

English uses the Latin alphabet. 

The long A sound in English is pronounced like the A in ‚Äúmate‚Äù.  The A in ‚Äúcar‚Äù is a short A. Millions of black african would want to learn russian to live in Russia, for the beautyful white russian females. Good intro, but the hard sign explanation is a bit off. It does follow consonants, but it does not just "make them hard". For example, the L sound does not need the hard sign to be hard because it is actually already hard without it. Instead, the hard sound makes a vowel after it stumble as if there were 2 words there instead of one. For example, in English we'd say something like "we'd say", and this "we'd" piece sounds completely different from "wed", but although in English it's only used for binding 2 words together, in Russian it would be the same pronunciation effect, but weirdly within 1 word, and there would be no way to expand the word as it would be already complete and in its full version. Is it true that the Russian word for "pizza" is the only word in the language with two —Ü's in a row? When I was five, and had mastered the English alphabet, my father showed me the Cyrillic alphabet.   A few letters caught my fancy, such as the house with legs, the asterisk, the ten with a hyphen, and of course, the backwards R, but I did not know a word of Russian.   So, one day I got a felt pen, and started writing random Cyrillic letters on the garage wall,  –Ø, –ñ, –¥ and —é.   My father saw my graffiti, and asked if I did that.  I hesitantly said I did, and thought I was in big trouble.  But he said, "Do you know what you just wrote?  You wrote 'I am waiting.'" 25 years ago I took two years of Russian in college. I'm happy to report I still remembered most of the alphabet. I can't speak a full sentence but I remembered most of the sounds! I'm sooooooooooooooooo glad Prof. Macura graded on a curve! Awesome channel and videos. Much love from Texas. –ö–æ—Ñ–µ in Russian reminds me of the tagalog word for coffee: kape –ú–Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫–æ—Ñ–µ –ú–Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –ñ is a second sound of J: [–¥–∂]
–© is just a soft variant of –®, and I have no idea why we have 2 separate letters in that particular case
(well probably historically there was more difference, but not any more)
so –© = [–®–¨], but –® letter never sounds soft, it is always hard, even when followed by the soft sound
and –© can never sound hard I wish you had been my teacher in Russian I class. Takes me back 46 years to when I learnt Russian at school.  I actually remembered more of the alphabet than I thought I would. Always loved the phonetic nature of the Russian language. Ochin spaciba. So it's like Finnish where one sound is one letter. Even though this says this comment is from James it is actually from his wife, Marianne. We spent one year in St Petersburg in 2003. If I could have stayed another year I am confident I would have been quite able to have been thinking in Russian and communicating well. Of course, my pronunciation would have been much improved too.  Your explanation of the alphabet is very helpful!  Most courses I‚Äôve taken did not help the way you have! I‚Äôm going to listen to this one until I refresh my memory about these sounds and then move on. I loved Russian people and I‚Äôm so sad that relations between our countries are not so good right now. Thanks for the good work!! I‚Äôd say that your pronunciation of Russian would be no different then a Russian would have with English. Day is not an example of y sounding like e at the end of a word. The name "Kelly" or would be an example. The first thing I noticed about Russian is the few but oddly stand out similarities to Spanish. So I looked up if and why that could be the case.

Thank you Goths.

Second is sounds the letters make in any alphabet is different even between languages using the same one. 

I see A I speak AH, I see E I say A. IE would also I. Unlike I√ã. And IJ does not Y. Unlike EI.

Adjusting again is not that big a deal aside from the too similar ones. –ê–ª—Ñ–∞–≤–∏—Ç—ã –ª–µ–≥–∫–æ –≤—ã—É—á–∏—Ç—å Cyka Blyat. Did I spell it right? great, thanks ! I am impressed you didn't stain your shirt with that marker in all the hustle. You are right about the letter D. Just like that one, every letter has a meaning. Some of them with small symbol on top even have a numerical value. Good presentation. However... Russian, Bulgarian or Serbian (Cyrillic) alphabet is NOT based on Greek, as some major sources based on the history written by Greeks, would lead you to believe. The alphabet natively called AZBUKA (named after first two letters Az and Buki) is based on much older set of characters that originate in Vinca culture in the Balkans (approximately 5700-4500 BC). Greeks came to Balkans much later and mixed with native Proto-Serbian population and adopted the characters, at least the ones they could pronounce, as their speech apparatus was and still is different. Cyrill and Methodius did not spread the literacy among Slavs, as the Azbuka already existed. They were on the mission from Pope, to introduce Christianity to mainly Moravia in local alphabet. But they, especially Cyril, got the laurels for introducing literacy. And the mainstream history, even in Russia and Serbia, still supports this story. I think my last name would be written as: –•–Æ–ñ Nail?  ?    . Stroke left overs.  Until. Why don't for a lesson. Take a movie with  Russian  sign or marking. A Sub?  Nail you can read Russian.  Russian movie signs  means stop don't touch this. Go back  no food this way,  out of order, Sorry Kris, but this is alphabet is Bulgarian alphabet. lady had all sentences in russian so here i am üò° In Greek the B is pronounced as a V. Do Russian universities have maser  degree programs in English, such as methods of teaching English, linguistic,literature.????? If yes please mention the name of University. Thanks alot . I'm 65 years old. I have always wondered what the Russian alphabet sounded like. Now I know. Thank you for breaking it down and explaining it so clearly. You are very easy to follow, which means you are a very good teacher. I also think it's fantastic that you are personalizing these lessons for your Mother. It is very heart warming that you love your Mother so much. <3  I'm going to follow at least several more of your lessons because I want to learn some basic and common words, phrases, and expressions. I look forward to learning from your very clear teaching style. (new sub) I am russian why you in my recommendation? liiiike i dont need to learn russian. ok i just grade your pronounce. Please do not stand in front of the white board, so people can look at it while you are speaking from the side of it! It would help beginners greatly! 
Spacebre! To really, really know a subject you need to be able to teach it! Your board is crooked.  Too much useless jibber-jabber. Forget his consultation. If you don't know someone in Russia who speaks the language, knows all about the bureaucracy (locations of gov. services, how and where to make appointments, costs), then you will have a difficult time. I recommend getting temporary residency permission. There's an initial language test you must take. You must have an Appostile done on your criminal record history or lack thereof. If you are in Russia at present, it will require an appointment to Moscow to get fingerprinted and a long waiting game after you mail your prints the U.S. That cost money too. You will be issued a new visa if you are successful, but you must not leave the country longer the 90 days in order to retain your visa. There are other avenues to get work permits using a work visa. Just be prepared to pay taxes regardless, and know the costs and processes. There are social taxes and medical insurance that must be paid too, which is calculated per month. If you do get temporary permission you must define yourself with the government, which will only allow you yo do certain types of work. You can be self employed or work for someone else. Your employer should pay your taxes, but the cost is so high many employers will avoid employing a foreigner. I am sure there's more to be said, but much of the information you can find on the internet. excellent presentation. i will watch this over and over to memorize this presentation.

When  I was a little boy (10)she would say terms of endearment in soft Russian to me.  I never understood being from rural New England. Now 82 and think of her making the immigration to the U.S. when she was only 14 to escape the pogroms.  Solid Russian stock and tough as nails.  She is missed.  I will watch your lessons and think of her struggling to learn English.  Nice presentation. Finally, now I can finally watch Masha and the bear in Russian I'm DELIGHTED to have found you! Thank you very much. Unmentioned: How St. Cyril also incorporated old Hebrew letters (e.g. shin) along with Greek (e.g. phi) to create this syllabary. The whole Russian alphabet really is an unusual amalgamation! It's pretty easy to learn Russian Alphabets using pronunciation of Indian Alphabets (Devnagari Alphabets). We have all these alphabets with exact pronunciations. We also have a concept of joint alphabets, which makes Russian Alphabets even easier to pronounce. Eg: ‡§§ + ‡§∏ = ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏ Just get on with it. But you speak so fast Thanks for everything.

Out of 100 to 150 Russia learning videos which i watched , this is the ultimate I feel.
My wholehearted Thanks to this Teacher.üôè I  love this teacher ,she makes it so simple for us to understand how Russian language works . She's really  great, thank you . hello like 3.4 B  Nice Video Thank You I am Turkey City ƒ∞stanbul Finally I can pronounce Hallo in Russian. Thank you! I fall in love just to listen her beautiful voice and accent, she is also very precise Hello Nathalaya it's beautiful name So important slower pronunciation is absolutely amazing. It is easier to have and understanding I can understand way better. That you have made this lesson way easier for me to speak and listen üëÇ I love the background music Hi Natalia what is name of the background soundtrack ? I want to listen to these ambient music when I study Russian all day! :) it will be cool if you add the music to all your teaching videos :D very helpful, thank you for this video! darling russia is very tuff  language perhaps.so russian write in english as you some some writing. play it in 2x speed is better Hello )))  –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç üëã Regards for Natalia. I came so if you say zavut, why do you write zovut ??? Learning memorizing useful sentences  gives very poor results. Because students can't learn many. Every one can learn a few telephone numbers but learning a new telephon number every day is not sustainable. Same thing with sentences.
I think the way to learn languages is to learn to read  stories. Then students can gradually improve their reading skills with the help of the teacher. When they can read fluently and they can read abundantly ( free voluntary reading ,  reading the books they choose) then the brain acquires more and more vocabulary in a sustainable way. And students acquire the grammar too, even though they are not aware of it because it is done subconsciously by the brain. Amazing, I wasn‚Äôt told any of these any of these things back when I started learning years ago. After I when out with this russian guy I met years ago on aol I remember his screename that cought my attention neboyayastaboy ever seens I love the russian language. can I merry you Your voice is very  hypnotizing.. Nice Natalia..

Listen this podcast ü§© just awesome üíØüíØ‚ù£Ô∏è To everyone saying it is not for beginners I'd argue that it is, if you watch beginner listening practice on other languages you'll see it is of a similar difficulty. Russian is a very hard language, it takes a lot of effort and hard work to speak, but you can't lower the standard of how proficient a beginner should be because of this. Its normal that it takes far longer to understand listening practice for in beginners in Russian compared to Spanish for example. (If your native language is English) 90 day practice daily 3 hour Russian is one of those languages where you have to listen and speak and read as much as you possibly can, even if you make mistakes. The more you expose yourself to Russian like these videos, the more you will start to recognize frequently repeated words. Also if you learn words on your own, you will hear them in the things you watch, read, or listen to. It's a delicate balance of seeking out new words and letting your brain pick out words it wants to know from repeated encounters. It's slow-going but studying grammar and formal approaches won't be as effective as jumping in and just letting your spongey mind do its thing. This video doesn't mean you need to magically know all the words. But find the patterns like how in every segment it says "a man and woman are talking" or a similar phrase. After watching a few segments you now know how to say man, woman, talking, etc. Same with the questions and any words you find useful. What do YOU want to talk about? Learn those words and fill in the rest later. how is it for beginners?? –ú–ù–ï –ü–û–•–£–ô –Ø –û–¢–õ–ò–ß–ù–û –ì–û–í–û–†–Æ –ü–û-–†–£–°–°–ö–ò There are a lot of people crying in this thread but am I the only one who picked up a few words and now understand at the least that our sentence structure‚Äôs aren‚Äôt the same?

Am I alone who think that "–æ–∂–µ—Ä–µ–ª—å–µ" (I dont know how will it translate to english))) not for beginners.

It is one of those, you understand what is being said in dialogue, since you are native speaker) Ughm, everyone complaining about how hard it is. But actually, native speakers, speak way  faster and not that robotic(let alone the fact that all the words are basic). Sometimes I do really think about starting a channel, since most of the videos focus only on rules, when the majority of Russian grammar is made up of exceptions rather than the legitimate rules. I think this is suitable for the A2 level so it's not that easy. I'm not learning Russian right now but I could understand like 3/4 because I know another Slavic language. I need lower level :( lol some answers are wrong you clearly don‚Äôt know what the word ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù means This is for Dostoevsky I would say this is at least for intermediate -mid to high level speakers U–º–∏—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Ç—Ü—Å—ã —Ç–æ—É–ø—ã–µ:D It indeed is for beginners... I took two semesters of Russian and this video is perfect practice –ß—Ç–æ —è –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –¥–µ–ª–∞—é... –ª–æ–ª "–Ø —Å –Ω–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–ø–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –∂–¥—É –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∫–∏" excellent useful expression.... you see I find much of your stuff good Check out my Russian progress video, I understood this video to a reasonable level after 3 months of practice. There‚Äôs a great method you can follow to learn fast –æ–ø—Ç–∏–∫ is an optician  .... they don't say glasses shop .  "—Ç–æ–π –∂–µ", and "–∞ –ø—Ä–æ"  are not expressions I've seen before but useful As a beginner do I really need to know how to say "rectangular shape" in Russian?    I think NOT Oh dear "–ø—Ä–∏–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∫–æ –º–Ω–µ —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º" what a  lazy translation.... what about translating "–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º" for us poor intermediate Russian students. Beginners??? NO WAY I can just hear beginners telling their Russian friends in russian "We should specify a particular date".  They would answer in Russian "Yes, that would avoid confusion and ensure completion of their obligations"  What a joke!! QUE I think you will find that "–≤—Å—ë"is translated "everything" rather than "it". Despite all my criticism,  this is a very useful video but it is for intermediate and certainly not for beginners. —Å–ª—É–∂–±–∞ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ –ø–∏—Ü—Ü—ã is PIZZA DELIVERY SERVICE?   why do you translate it as "This is a Pizza Station"? Wow!!!  Are you really  trying to tell us that –ø—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ç—å—Å—è is a useful verb for beginners in russian?  I'm not impressed "–∏ –≤—ã —É–≤–∏–¥–∏—Ç–µ –±–∞–Ω–∫" is  "and you will see a bank"  so why do you translate it as "and you can see a bank".  I recommend when translating : Keep it simple, accurate and try to follow the original word order as much as possible. DO NOT TRY TO EMBELLISH  TO SHOW HOW GOOD YOUR ENGLISH IS Fuck you Sorry to be a pain again  but "–ì–¥–µ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—É—Å–Ω–∞—è –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞?"  is best translated as "Where is the bus stop located?". An  inferior less helpul translation is "Where is the bus stop?"   However the latter simply comes from the easier" –ì–¥–µ  –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—É—Å–Ω–∞—è –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞?"  and.  NEVER does it mean "where the bus stop is". Keep it simple ... keep it helpful Overall the material is very good as my Russian is poor but here is another example "–∫–∞–∫–æ–∏ –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω –æ–Ω–∏ –≤—ã–±—Ä–∞–ª–∏?"  is What design did they choose? AND BETTER FOR LEARNERS than the more fancy "What design did they decide on?" You need to make translations easy and as close to the originals as possible. For example: –ß—Ç–æ –±—ã –≤—ã –ø–æ—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏? is muchy better as "what would you advise? " and NOT "What do you reommend?" which might be –ß—Ç–æ –≤—ã —Ä–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥—É–µ—Ç–µ?.  Russian is a very difficult language for us to learn. Its easy when absorbed during an infant's sponge years. This is very useful and well made, but it is at least B1 level, and some of the vocabulary is probably even B2, so definitely not for beginners. This is not for beginner Thank you so much if it is for beginners or elementary level. Because it is good method of teaching language. Others should learn I am from Russia, ahah.. Govno I'm a native speaker, I think it's for elementary students, definitely not for those who have started learning Russian from scratch but people speak really slowly in this video if we compare it with the speed of the real life conversation somewhere in a shop or in an office. In a way it wasn't bad but still I guess that they shouldn't have marked it for beginners, it's not actually true) if you want to study Russian, you should be really persistent, it takes a lot of time and effort but it's absolutely worth it!:) Lots of love from Moscow) Great stuff - very useful! :) HI EVERYONE IM GABRIRLLA Who needs help?

The best channel ‚ô° Fedor, I think you need to revisit this video. It is definitely incomplete. These –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç-–ø–æ–∫–∞ won‚Äôt apply to most of everyday situation, you can‚Äôt even use them in a shop let alone workplace and more formal areas. Same for –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞. Unlike English this question is considered personal and you never ask it to a teacher, a doctor, a plumber in your house etc. Also never in my 48 years I have heard ‚Äú—è —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ‚Äù. Honestly. We may say —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, but most popular answer is –Ω–æ—Ä–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ which is normal/ok. Cock Dealer i love so much for teaching us Russian for free!!! So grateful! Thanks a lot Hello, I just wanted to say that I've watched two of your videos and they helped me to understand Russian better. I am learning it as my third language,  I'm new to it. This is the second or third video i see from you, and Im really surprised right know, you make it easy for us. (sorry if my write sucks, Spanish is my native, and i just aqcuire English all this years with music and books) 1:17 sounds like he said "porra" that is a complainment in Portuguese haha How can i move to Russia üò¢ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ But how should I reply to "–ê —É —Ç–µ–±—è?" –∏–ª–∏ "–ê —Ç—ã?" ? If you're not going to provide phonetic pronunciation, this is close to useless. Showing the Russian word while quickly saying the word (what is "hello"? briv-yet? gribilet? byetlik? WHAT?) twice is actually totally useless. Entertaining but not useful. cute teacher –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ ü¶ã just a reminder. *never, ever say goodbye in Russian to a Japanese friend* Hi! I'm from Russia, and if you want to learn Russian - write, we can communicate in social networks. Practice with a native speaker helps a lot. I'm learning English, and I'm looking for someone who speaks it well or is a native speaker. We will help each other practice in the languages we learn. Can someone please write the phonetic sound of "I'm bad" using English letters for me? For the life of me I cannot understand what letters those are. Sorry, I'm a beginner lol Algum BR por aqui??

This is how children learn & adults are just children in bigger bodies. I vied to Russia last year - and I smaak the country and its people. I want to learn Russian. Damn she hot asf Real teacher. Keep moving forward what's the background music of this video? could somebody tell me I would like to be your student The background music is quite disturbing. Can it be dropped? Spaseba mam Aaargh - the music. Your charming face and suit voice injected injected us the pleasent atmosphere of Russian number system. Plus wonderful teaching technique.Keep on uploading such kind of interesting video. Omg, she sounds like she‚Äôs having phone sex or something, way too sexual This is the best video on this topic that I have seen. Thank You!! Nice Video.

Spaciba 
Sincerely  Ren√© Lesieux  rene.lesieux@gmail.com Excellent! Short and straight to the point. Ordering food and saying please and thanks is the first thing I usually do when I'm on holiday.
Far too many language videos contain phrases with too many words, or stuff which isn't essential for tourists (like asking how old someone is)
This one only contained stuff I actually need as a tourist. SO NICE.... Wow exactly what i want to learn Russian I love this idioms. Spasibo This was very good.. not too much and not too little and repeating the words slowly. I hope she did more! NATASHA FROM RUSSƒ∞A woooooow you are the best. I love. yours THAMIR from Iraq. Ms. Natalia, Hello, I want to say that I just recently started "re-learning" Russian, after having dropped the study like a hot rock, about 15 years ago. I  not only started studying Russian again, but I am studying harder than before, because I have a lot more time to do so. 

I also want to say that compared to the girls around here, where I currently live, in the USA, your beauty, if that is your true photograph  on your video, makes your beauty superior to any lady around here, EXCEPT for another Russian lady  here, in my neighborhood. Great graphics. A smooth building up of vocabulary and phrases. Thank you. amaazing Love the speed of your lessons , not too fast ,  and  , the emphasis you give on the pronunciation of the words . Only drawback is the red used for the words . The contrast makes it difficult to read ,You are an excellent teacher . –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ.

I have watched this video over and over and I think it works so I think I have learned something about your video. Spasibo! Good lesson. Impossible language. An English speaker will have to reposition their mouth in angles they're not used to just to pronounce some of the words. It's not like learning an easy language like German for example. Spacibo bolshoi...I like your Russian course and I have learned all the phrases though writing is difficult, how can I learn how to write in Russian? Wow.  The video was very helpful to me . I'm in Russia for almost a week now and I   can help myself out since I started watching your videos. Thanks very much and please post more. Now im here in Russia and i see the importance of learning the language.... Natalia - means "Christmas Day". So your day is coming soon. I hope it goes very well for you as you have blessed so many people with your truly unique (lovely) voice and very efficient method of teaching Russian language!

Can anyone provide any insight on this? Thank you for making the video its very interesting. Russian women are the most beautiful in the world . what Your channel is really helpful and really help me to understand Russian.  Video is beautifully taken with some break with Russian Scenery. However I feel not easy with the opening music volume which too loud and probably 2-3 times louder than the conversation. The think is I need to repeatedly to lower volume when it come to opening / closing music and need to restore volume when it come to converstation. It will be nice if the music and conversation keeping in the same level of volume. Thanks. –û—Å–µ–Ω—å –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ üòÅüòÅüòÅ !!!

I have been watching the one on serving tea over and over and I'm beginning to get it and also understanding cases a bit.

Bulgarian studying Russian for 1 month = a person from France studying Russian for 2 years You could include the spelling of the numbers in the conversations I feel so much better now I've read the comments!  hahaha no way is this absolute beginner level This is perfect!!! <3
I'm Polish thought, so maybe it's easier for me ;D Really useful :) Tahnk you so much I played this video 0.75 slower and it's MUCHHHH BETTER I think this video is pretty good for a beginner within their first 6 months. I have been studying Russian for about 4 months (maybe an 1-2 hours day on average) and I kind of know what's is going on in the scenarios and conversations. But do I understand every word (or even 75 percent)? Absolutely not. But this is helpful for learning new words. Thank god 0/0 üòÇ I know how to talk having a problem with listening I started to learn  russian today and I know some bad words from cs:go.

I can understand but it is not absolute beginners at all....... I am a Polish guy and i know Russian only from CSGO and I understood everything, Kinda funny Russianpod, you and me understand "absolute beginner" very differently. This looks like I don‚Äôt even know anything again I keep hearing a word that sounds like "mushina." Stay is that word? Understand nothing üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I think this is great - fun, and repeats the same vocabulary so that it sticks. However, I agree with other commenters that it isn't absolute beginner level - I've studied Russian before and have a fairly good grounding in the grammar, numbers, time etc. It's just my vocbulary and comprehension skills that are lacking. There must be easier exercises out there for true beginners. Thank you for the good content! You mean by absolute beginner intermediate? Makes more sense. Fk me the interruptions are annoying af 1. 1:09

4. Tell me again how on earth this is for ABSOLUTE beginners?!?! I‚Äôve been studying russian an hour every day for 5 weeks with skype calls to Russian speakers. My teachers say I am not at a level to speak yet but I should try listening to more and I should understand. –Ø –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—é!! Not one sentence did I understand... I‚Äôm close to giving up! great for intermediate learners - b1 - b2 Beginner level?  I don't think so.  How large a vocabulary do you need to understand this?   Can someone recommend an actual beginners resource for listening? with 3 year study Russian. I think it is fine. about B1 I blelieve. a little better when i put the video in slow motion .75 speed..but beginners no way No meme this time, but just wanted to leave this here. 

So, right after the soviet union collapsed my family along with basically the entire village migrated from Kazakhstan back to Germany (the village consisted of german immigrants, who came to Russia under the rule of Catherine II. and were later relocated from the Wolga river far into the country by Stalin).
My family was part of it and they managed to start over here in Germany. What I now am really grateful for is that apart from being a native German speaker I can mostly understand my family speaking Russian as well, because I grew up with it more or less.
Now what I¬¥m trying to do is also learn the active part of Russian such as speaking and writing, since it always was left behind in a mostly german environment outside home.
Thanks RussianPod 101 for offering this course for free. And I hope that those who are starting from 0 stay motivated, because apart from the memes it is a beautiful language with beautiful people in it! The way they pronounce words is weird af I‚Äôm Russian and the speakers sound so bad. The man even has an accent of some kind. The way they make sentences is also very unnatural( I hope it only concerns Russian and not other languages of this series I don‚Äôt know about you guys, But other than a few verbs and hard-to-pronounce words I can‚Äôt recognize, I think I can understand this just fine Really really perfect you are.. It would be grand if you didn‚Äôt put so many adverts in Who tf thought this was for ‚Äúabsolute beginners‚Äù!? I am preparing for my Russian A2 exam and I would say this video fits my requirement perfectly well! It is definitely not for absolute beginners, but for beginners who have some background in learning Russian. –ê—Ö–∞—Ö–∞ —è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π im from russia Fue no entiendo una verga I just learned most of the alphabet and learned how to say Privet.  I thought I was an absolute beginner. if the way they talk is truly an absolute beginner I might as well just quit right now as I am so slow and stupid as to not understand a word they said.  This is disheartening Absolute beginner? Yeah, F you. Reported for misleading title. I've been studying for four months.

@sanie_www
insta. Two years ago, I barely understood a word. Now I understand every word. That's what I call progress! üòÖ I only understood a few words. With subtitles very helpful –£ –Ω–∏—Ö –≥–æ–ª–æ—Å –∫–∞–∫ –∏–∑ –º–µ–º–æ–≤ –≤ –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ:/ i consider this a sink or swim,  at first its shocking but then it 'grows' they speak slow enough and without shaving off words...it's quite complete as far as losing all the distraction and making it practical.  Just pick up a few words over and over until you can fill in the sentences as we go, and as words are recognizable, the idea is to get the gist, then eventually the rest... Okay, this is definitely not for absolute beginners, but not too hard either, because I'm A1 level, and i could understand some words and this way i got some right, and others i had no idea at all. So yeah, probably A2 level. do bre beacher. Well, first of all, I have went through the first dialogue and I can hear that the speakers are clearly not native, they all have an accent. Their pronunciation is good, but the accent is still there. And another thing that needs to be said is that their speech is rather unnatural and most of the sentences they say are not build ‚Äúthe Russian way‚Äù.
And yes, I am a native Russian speaker and a Russian teacher. Its very nice video for veginner, –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ I think it is not posible to do a good listening if you are an absolute beginner. I understand what's going on in this podcast in almost in 95 percent, but I am learning this language for one year (more or less frequently) and my mother tongue is polish, with is a little bit similar to russian, but i totally agree that this is not for absolute beginners ;/ This is almost B1 level in my opinion –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∑–∞ —É—Ä–æ–∫–∏! –ê–¥–º–∏–Ω–∫–∞ —è —É–∑–±–µ—á–∫–∞ —è –æ—á–µ–Ω—å —Ö–æ—á—É –∏–∑—É—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏ –≤—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∞—Ç—å I'm a beginner and they're speaking way too fast Yo guys, this is actually a really good way of learning, it's fast because that's how THEY TALK, they talk fast in every day conversation, so just practice, if you don't get it the first few times, just listen to it 100 times over, and you'll be able to do it! Don't worry guys Both speakers sounds like germans who good speak Russian but still have a little accent For absolute beginners of intermediate level :))) If you cross out 'absolute' then the title will be accurate. –¢–∞–∫ —Å–º–µ—à–Ω–æ —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å , –∫–∞–∫ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –ø—ã—Ç–∞—é—Ç—Å—è —É—á–∏—Ç—å —Ç–≤–æ–π —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —è–∑—ã–∫!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòàüá∑üá∫üòÜ this is definitely more than a year of learning. not absolute beginner at all I thought instead of —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∏ they use –ª—é–¥–∏ in the plural... Interestingly you can and should do the same in German. In the singular human is Mensch, in the plural it's Menschen, but there exists a second form, a plurale tantum that sounds very similar to the Russian equivalent and is likely related to it etymologically: Leute. Usually the correct plural of Mensch would be Leute, and the plural Menschen is reserved for referring to the species. But in the last decades people more and more resort to Menschen even though they mean Leute. Well, it might not be for absolute beginners, but if you listen it all the way through you will notice that it is a repeating pattern. You will almost all the time find the same people talking to each other (e. g. a man and a woman, a salesman/-woman and a woman etc.) and the vocabulary is not very diverse. As an absolute beginner this is ridiculously complicated, but if you are a little advanced and have learnt how to inflect nouns, adjectives and verbs, it should work out after some time of getting used to it. My Russian listening skills are crap. :( 

Maybe I give up. This is why even hough I paid good money to use RP 101 I have not been there very often. The only thing I did not pay for was their 1 on 1 lesson teacher stuff. So for paying up front for "2"  years, I am completely lost   (((( Disappointed in RP 101   By the way I am a pensioner so that money was a lot of dinners This is not beginners at all " HoW aRe yOur rUsSiAn listening sKilLs"

Considering I've been learning Russian for 3 years and just about heard a few phrases, not too good Gabriella, not too good. If this is for absolute beginners, then I'm way worse at Russian than I thought I was! Wish it had direct translations, otherwise good lesson I'm looking for a language exchange partner I can help your with Spanish or English NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  I've been living in Russia for a year, studying 30 minutes a day, and speaking with locals many times a week.  I can catch a few words but still have NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON. Finally able to get this with self-study; 1 year + 3 months from when I first learned the alphabets.  Today it seems, everything come together for the first time and I no longer rely on subtitles and ventured into questions I've never heard before and got their answers right.  Still need a lot of replay in some places.  Doable, but not for absolute beginner.  ) Also Please scribe my channal as named as "click-Mintika". if you like and share it to your friends...... –Ø –±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–ª–µ—Ü –∏ –∏–∑—É—á–∞—é —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫. –Ø —Ä–∞–¥, —á–∏—Ç–æ–±—ã —è –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª –≤—Å–µ. –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ. this is not absolute beginner indeed Du bist sehr nett frau ‚ù§
ich liebe dich ‚ù§ "beginner" All correct, I want to practice Russian plz, I can  help with English , French and Arabic  in return Excellent. But not beginner. I have studied Russian for 3 years, but 3 years ago, this would have been very difficult. This channel is a useful supplement to careful grammar study. What the hell fank you .  you are very good. For absolute beginners?  Way beyond me! Absolute Beginner to me means sub-A1 - this lesson is *way* above that.

There's plenty of video on how to write russian letters, but not on how to actually right russian words and thus connect letters to each other . Helpfull video Which letters need the loop (curl) in front when they are bound with other letters. Like for instance: –õ –ú –Ø - i know that before these letters there's a loop.

I kept searching on this fucking internet for a simple question, which is the principal or what letters need the loop in front. And no result. I am so damn angry!!!

I don't have enough phlegm to pronounce half of the Russian alphabet. –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ!!! I've been studying Russian for about two months now, I know its a bit early for me to learn how to write it, but I think it'll be a helpful thing to learn. Your writing is so pretty and I love watching your videos!
(edit: fixed a typo) When you say "big" and "small", do you mean "capital" and "normal" ? In my first form in school my teacher made a bit different letters, just like in a picture, when you search in google "russian cursive alphabet ", she shows a bit simplified letters like "for fast writing" I write in cursive, but in my native language teachers always told me "I don't want you to write like that 'cause I can't understand" or "I won't accept any more jobs with that letter" (never changed my writing, though), so when I found out Russian is written in cursive it filled me with joy. üíõ –ú–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –º–Ω–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –≤—ã—É—á–∏—Ç—å –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –∏ –≥—Ä–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—É—Ä—Å–∏–≤? –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –æ–±–ª–µ–≥—á–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—è) *american people:* reads russian letters like english letters.

Thank you so much with this :D but then I love to write the printed Russian more than the handwriting XD I love russian The Spencerian script highly influenced the fighting all over the world, and it largely affected the writing system of languages using the Cyrillic alphabet. As you can see, actually write, it‚Äôs very noticeable. Actually the smal letter "–∑" in cursive reminds me of the letter "z" in old german writing. Its called "S√ºtterlin script". My grandma used to write this script. She was born in 1927. However they went from what basically looks like "A" to an almost English cursive "D" to a lowercase "g" is absolutely beyond me.

Only me thought some of them like japanese? First of all, ‚Äú Teacher is Hot ‚Äú . Secondly, I have gone through many many ways of learning this fascinating language however I find Daria has the skill, experience, patience and politeness to her presentation therefore I subscribed to her channel and solely follow her.

What I've found most interesting is that the initial premise is blown.

I was instructed that the point of cursive handwriting is to NOT lift the —Ä—É—á–∫–∞. The only times you lift is when dotting i and j and crossing t and x.

All the lifting seems either superfluous or indictment.  

The best part is the connection.  We've seen the memes, but from what I understand, it's almost a point of pride to make things illegible. Just discovered your channel - I love how calmly and clearly you explain things. –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ! Very helpful. Thank you. I find working with one or two letters a day helps me retain it more.

Great job. Cnaciba. I'm going to try learning a language without study the grammar first, to see how I can learn better.

If you speak russin  you don't use  —Ç—ã  only in friend Hello there from Norway. Actually I find this woman/teacher to be the very best of all Russian-teachers I have watched so far here on YouTube. But I cant find anywhere where she teaches about Greetings? I must say that I am glad to be here.  Thanks for teaching.  I am new in Russia and I am willing to learn.  You are the best so far.... fuck the ruZZia This an excellent beginner tutorial.  One suggestion to make it better..... in between the Russian phrase and the final English translation, the Russian should be translated literally.  For example:- –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ literally means "big thanks", the ideal English translation you have listed is "Thank you very much".  As a beginner it would help A LOT to see the literal translation first, then the ideal English translation.
It would help in vocabulary building, and in understanding the word order of Russian phrases. –ú–Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫. –Ø –∏–∑—É—á–∞—é —ç—Ç–æ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.üôèüèªüëçüèª THANKS !

Can try this instead: slow Russian - fast English - fast Russian I appreciate that your videos are short because they load up faster. Also your choice of useful phrases is the best I‚Äôve seen yet. In addition, the repetition in three different speeds is very helpful for beginners seeking a bit more challenge. Thank you very much. Thank you üôè

This is probably a silly question, when an option is either a masculine word or a female word , how is this used, do you have to use the masculine form when addressing a male and the feminine form when addressing a female , or , is it the form you choose depending on if you are male or female . I hope you will forgive my confusion,  and thank you in advance for your help and all the great video. Best wishes Great Hi Kristina. Thanks for another cool video. This video is really very nice.

Ochen Kharasho! üê≤üêæ Thanks for the video. It's great to hear a REAL person saying the words and not a robot voice  ))   my big frustration is that I try sooooo hard to remember stuff (for a long time now) and when i close my eyes and just listen, there are still so many (more than 50%) words or phrases that 1) i still dont know or 2) they are familiar but i cant automatically know what they are so I need to open my eyes to read your words.   Oh well, I guess more practice needed   ))  And yes, I am sure someone (as they have on other videos) will comment and say that "these are basic, please give something harder", but I will only be saying that when I have mastered all that you have given in these "basic" (but still hard for me), wonderful lessons. May I ask, .........   any suggestions as to how to climb over the wall from knowing a bunch of words to being able to absorb what people are saying in a conversation? I know "practice practice practice" is the most obvious way, but are there any "techniques" to make the practice more efficient please?   EDIT!!!   I just saw that I had commented 7 months ago   )))   Yep, I still think it is a great video   )))))))) I took my last college Russian class the year the WWW was rolled out (1994).  All we had were books and pencils. Like monks in a monastery.  Did not learn much. I signed up for your "News in Slow Russian". It is a great training tool,  and totally worth it.  Please keep the content coming. Thanks! I listened to the first 50 phrases.  They don't seem like ones I'll use right away.  How about phrases devoted to things I'll do in Russia:  exchange currency, buy tickets, order at a restaurant, pay for items in a shop etc.    I know no list can be all inclusive but I don't know when I'll use most of what is spoken here. this program was very useful thank you  –±–æ—à–æ–µ —Å—Ä–æ—Å–∏–±–æ Thanks for this video.

As in every country, the pronunciation differs if the person lives in the capital or in the countryside or Siberia!    So explain more about pronunciation tones regions... Thanks! Parecen clases de ingl√©s y no de ruso. thank you so much !!  please keep make videos like this .  ! When is the '–≥' pronounced as a w/v and when as a g (as in get) ? You are the best Russian teacher I have found on YouTube. I plan on listening to all of your videos. You‚Äôre the best my beautiful teacher There are lots of channels teaching Russian but you are the best I can read Russian signage but can't pronounce them and spoken Russian is fast. I like your lesson very detailed and clear for students like who speaks English as second language and soon Russian will my third. Thank you very much. üñíüñí Perfect teacher ! Much better than my Russian wife ))) Hello there! I have a question about the 500 Conversational Russian sentences download. It says that it includes audio, but I was wondering if it is one long audio recording with all the sentences, or if each sentence has its own audio file? If they are not individual audio files, would you be able to release a downloadable version like this? Individual audio files would help so much to make flashcards in a program like Anki. It would be perfect! Thanks for any info Wow! This video is super helpful. I LOVE how you say the phrase 3 times.

'Kak' means 'how' and 'kakoe' means 'which'. whats the difference between kak and kakoe good give us more verbs there are abut 500 verbs You have mistaked in your comment - you must be wrote - "–ú–Ω–µ(not –ú–µ–Ω—è) –Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è –≠–¢–û(not –≠–¢–û–¢) –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ". because "–ú–µ–Ω—è" this word uses when you tell about situations - "I was beaten" - "–ú–µ–Ω—è –ø–æ–±–∏–ª–∏". But when you say that "I like icecream", or "I don't like him" you must say "–ú–Ω–µ –Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è" but not "–ú–µ–Ω—è". understood? =) i don't think it's very useful for beginners, unless you want to practice pronunciation, the grammar is not explained and it is very confusing for someone who learns russian  thank you @chimpanze34123 thanks for writing I'll try Thanks im a beginner so this is very helpful.Can you do more videos for beginners please? @TheKarate10 
I'm sorry, but I think you are wrong.. The way I see it, there aren't any mistakes. Btw I cannot say the same regarding your comment in Russian ;) @grimmerMD i already can read cryllic and write in russian.. I requesting that he makes a intermediate video ive have passed beginner stage. just saying @RussianPlus please make some more videos it will be more helpful. like intermediatte level. when i said write the words so we can see. i was meaning toward  end of this video. you read the sentences but we couldn't see the words.  @walnuthouse991 ok thanks for your comment he talking way to fast. next video go slower and write the words so we can see  The speaker goes way too fast.

If the English word ends with -tion, then change the ending to -—Ü–∏—è (-tsyia), and the translation will be the same.

For example:
Nation - –Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è (natsyia)
Constitution - –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏—è ( konstitutsyia)
Transaction - —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∑–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è (tranzaktsyia)

I learned a lot from the video 
thanksI got a ton of these videos on my recommendation page while trying to learn Russian, so I tried a different video i had saved and this listen while you sleep method is sort of weird because I couldn‚Äôt sleep with the noise provided by the audio. So about 3 and a half hours in I remembered very little but when I rewatched the video everything sounded familiar. So i‚Äôm confused as to what‚Äôs happened, did I fall asleep or did time just pass quickly?

But there are 2 potential things to take from that experience. 
1-It keeps you up at night and nothing happens
2-You do kind of remember and it would work to understand a conversation but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to speak We've got a job to do Feedback : nice to have the English pronunciation as well (like spa-SEE-ba for thank you) I wish I could sleep 11 hours Good video, but the sound quality of male russian voice is bad, sounds "metallic"/unnatural, especially in slow speed. I‚Äôm American. Why all of a sudden do I want to learn Russian? I know some of the words and I know how to do the accent let‚Äôs see if this works to add it on..

I doubt it my friends :( but I did learn how to calculate without calculator while I was sleeping but I was experiencing a sleeping illness so maybe it doesn't count because I was sleeping 23hours a day so... Nice 69 comments, but im about to ruin it all The woman's pace is perfect. The man speaks too slow, and too fast. best video ever i sen ‚úÖ üëçüèæ Mi abuelita dice:: c√≥mo pueden estudiar con √©sa m√∫sica horrenda y antipedagogica del oscurantismo medieval!!!

I just wake up in 5:24:07 üòéüòéüòéüòéüòé "Where are your children?"
"I have one in my car."
"Is this a safe area?" this is creepy and who needs to know where my kids are?

Gracias Al productor de este Formidable Video. A BLACK BACKGROUND would be really nice to have. People who want to sleep need a dark background with white font. This video is not for day studying. So for your next videos, please place a dark background. Color: #444; or darker. I fell asleep watching this and had a nightmare that a Russian plague doctor was chasing me asking where my children were funny that you think i can sleep about 12 hours... hope i could actualy it s realy annoying sleeping 5 hours per night This is your best video in the series.

open english to russian translator 
and type any indian word or name and hear its pronounciation in russian you will be amazed that every word has proper pronunciation as it should be in  sanskrit 
try krishna  raam or any other name you  will be amazed 
first time i tried i understood that russian is very very silmilar to sanskrit It is very interesting to learn languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom all countries, especially from a big country like Russia.  Even though I have never been there, learning Russian is very fun ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç I wish there were English alphabet displayed sounding out the words.    There is something very Arabic sounding about Russian. Question: Why is the Russian word for hedgehog useful vocabulary? Are hedgehogs running rampant in Moscow streets? Is there an approaching hedgehog apocalypse?  Or is "hedgehog" a euphemism for some common Russian lascivious conduct? Just curious. Man this language is such a pain in the ass to learn lmfao You Know Russian sounds so complicated maybe Spanish is easier idk how  Did i even learned English This is so useful thank you for the infoüòâüòâüòâ *FREE FRENCH CLASSES*

Gihan panditha So grateful for your thoughtful inclusion of the the Russian words for: lady bug, gorilla, Ottava, hockey, koala,  raspberry, hurricane & other such useful words among the 2000 essential words for foreigners in Russia! Of course I'll need to repeat them hundred of times to remember them, but at least if I ever get lost in Moscow, I would always be able to tell someone - in my  best Russian accent of course - "koala, hurricane, gorilla, lady bug", rasberry, hockey & I'm sure somebody there could direct me straight away to "Ottava"'s mental health asylum.

Any response is appreciated. –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ "Sto trillionov", a word every Russian beginner must know, ha ha . When it's about a verb, it would be wise to add "to" before the English verb. Also, words like "far" are rather understood as adverbs, hence : daleko, rather than dal√´ky. Very strange word choice Awesome words. I think it would have been better to order them from most used words to least used words imho. Badly recorded !!! This is intermediate/advanced level. 200-300 words is defined as beginner in language learning Can you start another series "100 -2000" with completely new words. I know there is more than 2000 Russian words.  THANKS! I'm here. May I ask what program you used to make the slides? 2000 Words Every Russian Beginner Must Know...Ottawa? Madrid? etc etc Really?! I am a beginner and 80% of the words, so far , I have watched are not important to me at all! Thanks anyway!!!!! Armadillo,sea lion vs. seriously? Will there be a 2100 word video??

A little bit hard to clarify the words, good luck to you Natalia. You habe such pretty eyes Don't forget to watch russian movies with english subtitles to get the hang of russian words. Russian people have a wonderful spirit! In spite of all the english influences, they still manage to keep their own special character, language included. Thank you Natalya. Hey Natalia again thank you, you did a very good job with the presentation. I had heard that Spanish has simple pronunciation rules as well, I was beginning to think Russian might be a little harder but your explanation of the simplicity of the rules was very encouraging. You speak English very well, I say this because I have watched some of the other videos on here and have noticed the teachers make mistakes in the use of words that have a similar meaning but in the context English speakers never use those words that way , and in this you have learned English very well, you are very thorough when you research or study a given subject. I am not saying they are bad teachers , from what I have heard English can be a very difficult and confusing language depending on the native language of the learner.  You probably speak English in many ways better than a lot of Americans, but I have heard this is common in all countries, many never correctly learn their own native language, slang is the common vernacular. I just hope I can learn Russian as well as you have learned English...again thank you for all your help! –ê —è –∏–∑ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ in the cover you look fun but the video is very serious and formal. i saw other language video, in fact I try perfecting my english pronunciation via youtube, and lot of them are so fun and relax.

but seriously, your contents are very easy to understand. üñíüñí Thanks for this very useful video.

Question: Is devoicing of consonants at the end of words an invariable rule, as in German? Or does it just happen in certain situations? Thank you very much. Very nice...very pretty, too ! ! ! thank alot i love your lessons i am trying to teach myself Russian, where is the best place to start? This video is where I think is best to start. if I can't pronounce words I will struggle to learn, although I find this video informative, knowing when a sound is hard or soft is still confusing.

A few days ago I just decided to teaching myself Russian language like I did it with English.
I have found an old material that got me interested in it even I had to find a CASETTE player to listen an audiobook. Yes that old! But I was wondering how the Russian people sounds nowdays and doing my research I have found your videos that now have become quite helpful to me.
I hope one day to visit Russia more specificly a city call Novosibirsk.

... Thanks üëçüëçüëç Hei Nat√°lia Obrigado pelo video, √©s uma Mulher muito Linda! SPASIBA! This is a VERY helpful series of lessons on pronunciation.  I like to focus on pronunciation first, and continuously, so that as I begin to build a vocabulary I'm not confused by words that deviate from the simple alphabet pronunciations, and so that I don't have to essentially relearn vocabulary after later pronunciation improvement.  Thanks so much for making these complete pronunciation lessons available in a very well organized collection.  Also, for better and worse, I must say that your beautiful piercing blue eyes are at once both captivating, holding my focus, and also distracting, leading my mind off to the idea of traveling sometime soon with the hope of meeting someone as mesmerizingly attractive and smart as you.  Thanks again for your excellent lesson presentations. Thank you nice . greetings - i can show you how to make a very cheap auto-cue (so you don't look like you are reading the screen) are you on VK? shes speaking as if she's seducing pierce brosnan! ROFL! shes speaking as if she's seducing pierce brosnan! ROFL! y do I feel like I'm watching a James bond movie? lol! Thanks for this video. Thank you Natalia, I am just starting to learn Russian, and watching your video today, I feel that you have given everything AND more to help me make progress, because you explain it very precise, and with a lot of detail, and you also use normal language to explain things, like the use of the word 'softness' - you give it to us in a really helpful way, to aid in my understanding. I understood everything you have said in lesson 1, and I think after watching it a few times, I will be happy to move to lesson 2 - I would also like to say, without any agenda, that I could listen to your teaching all day long! It is hypnotic just listening to you. Thank you again, Mark. i just wanna say that...

About non-native speakers :) Thank You Natalia! Your videos have helped me along the way to understanding the Russian Language - I like your videos Best, perhaps because you include a Lesson - not just a topic and a video on that topic - you teach us some things about the two languages, English and Russian. Thank You! Do Svidanya! this was soooo helpful thankyou very much!! Most beautiful woman! Thank you very much for the video :) Helped me a loooooot Natalia, ...though your pronunciation of English has a definite Russian accent, (but it is so charming!), and, yet, you obviously have a very good mastery of English vocabulary, and, you are very clear in what you are saying. => A Great introductory lesson!   I hope that, someday, I can learn Russian pronunciation, as well, and would like to at least learn to read with some degree of fluency, as I have a few books, (on the subjects of jewelry, and metalworking), that I'd like to be able to translate someday.  Thank you, very much! Thank you for this video! I'm learning Russian right now and your video has really helped me I need Russian girlfriend to teach me the language.¬† You are so beautiful.¬† I love your accent too. very understandable.excellent pronunciation.

Hi Natalia xD We have the same name! I love russian, it sounds great to me... I think Russian is difficult, but you can learn everything with effort. Thank you for taking time to do this I really wanted someone who is russian to help me with a doubt.
The name Olga is written ‚Äò–û–ª—å–≥–∞‚Äù in russian, right? Ok.
But some magazines wrote the name as ‚Äú–û–ª—å–≥–∏‚Äù and I really wanted to know why, because –∏ has a ‚Äúi‚Äù sound =S
Please, if anyone could answer this, I would be very happy. you're eyes so beautiful ... my partner is Russian so of course she is helping me learn for when I go this year, but this is a great extra help for me.

—è –∏–¥—ÉÃÅ - I go

This really helps with my research.  I am writing a debut novel, historical romance about a Russian countess who in the 1840s goes to London and falls in love with an Indian artist.

Epiphanies happen so rarely, and are nearly impossible to share. I can't think of any words that may fully convey this moment. Gorgeous Russian woman... Here is an audiobook about russians https://youtu.be/AiBLap5414c My girlfriend, a Muscovite, agrees with your approach. That you bring up appropriate points,such as, on the hard consonants amount other salient points. It is certainly very helpful. Thank you. Amazing, thank you. Helped me alot The methodical explanations followed by demonstrations are the best I've seen, and I studied Russian both on my own and in classes. Thank-you. Thanks!!!  Very helpful!!! Good mam Thank you very much! It helped a lot. Thank you Natalia. This is by far the best explanation of this sound that I have come across. I really found it to be very helpful indeed. My grandparents came from Russia in 1888. Last name Zbaney, Wish I knew how to pronounce Very helpful, thanks! cyka blyat! can't ya smile! spesiba The problem is not so much making the sound, which isn't so hard when using methods such as those in your video. The challenge is being able to say it naturally in the middle of a word without focusing so much attention on it that you have no chance of doing anything else such as thinking what you are saying or what word comes next! Wonderful! the best explanation I¬¥ve heard of —ã. Thank you very much. Still goddamn difficult but this really helps —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∏–∑ –ö–≤–µ–±–µ–∫–∞! You were born to teach language. Very helpful, spasibo HARD CONSONANTS?  YOU MEAN ALL OF THEM? I really like the diagrams! I don't hear phoneme nuances, but a picture says a thousand words. I've had someone try to explain this before but no luck. The diagram makes a huge difference! This was very helpful.¬† I have yet to see the book that can adequately describe this sound without misinforming a student; it must be heard, repeated, and practiced, not just guessed at from someone's opinion of the sound. This video in particular had me subscribe to your channel.¬† –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ! Thank you so much, I can finally pronounce it!)) I've started learning Russian language for almost a week and I care about correct pronunciation in every language i start. I'm really happy to find your channel before entering to this language... –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª–∏—è!

Thank you! does it sound like oo-we? in english? —ã came easily to me. Heard it once, just pronounced it. Still can't roll my R's though. ): Also, women in China would die for skin like yours.

'I wish I could tell you each one of my students mastered it perfectly, but that would not be true..........because the ones that didn't were sent to Siberia ,to be devoured by tigers....' ....*icy cold stare into camera* Interesting, challenging, and great lesson. you are easy to learn from. Is it anything like '≈ìil' (French for eye)? well we already have √¢ in our language. extremely easy. not hard at all. I am romanian and we have the letter  " √Æ "   wich is very similar actually, and also doesn't have equivalent in any western language and it was relatively simpler to learn that way. For me It was like the sound of " √Æ " + " i "(e in english ) pronounced together.

This is a very helpful video. wow thanks this really helps. excelente! muchas gracias! muy pedag√≥gico y con informaci√≥n detallada y valiosa! Natalia thank you for this lesson, I pretty much had the pronunciation down  before I watched it. Actually we have an expression that is close depending on how people say it, it  is the word yuck  and it 's generally used to describe something that tastes nasty " oo yuck", especially if something tastes bitter ,like you want to vomit...that is about as close as English speakers have to approximating  the bi sound,  I also wanted to thank you for emphasizing proper pronunciation, to speak any language correctly you have to learn the discipline of correct pronunciation and grammar , when we were young my mother was very strict about proper pronunciation and she hated slang , she would stress grammar and proper structure and phrases....most people don't even speak proper English....so thank you for taking the Russian Language seriously in your  teaching presentations Good video, thanks for the time and effort to make it. It indeed helped me to understand the sound better.
Hope this comment won't bother you, but when you mention hard consonants the graphic that shows is of hard and soft vowels, that could confuse some people. –´ is like ill in English? –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ, –ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—è!  This is a very helpful lesson to pronounce –´, a very difficult letter!  I will watch this many times and practice. you are very stupid no idea what yu are taking obout 1000 LOLs Wow! Thanks. The tightening of the throat was the last piece I was missing. What a difference it makes! Much appreciated. I found this to be very helpful. Amusingly, this is actually close to the sound I tend to make when I'm exasperated with something. This was very helpful. Thank you, this is really helpful! I have one question, though. You claim that it's not possible to pronounce –∏ after a hard consonant. I'm wondering if this applies mainly to English speakers only. I'm a native Finn and we have the hard consonants in Finnish, too. However, I find no trouble pronouncing –∏ (our "i") after a hard consonant. —ã=uoy? great love to learn russian menya zavot sangeen e pakistana kak dela Spaceba, nice lesson.. I'm an English teacherfrom America living in Japan, and I know teaching a language isn't easy, so I really appreciate your effort. You are a very good teacher, Thanks for that, confusing but I'll get it, If you see this Thanks Thalwen!!! I found this really helpful, now to make my tongue and lips obey and one go in directioun of /u/ and other in in direction of /i/ :) Thanks a lot! Thank you so much . Advice on tongue placement and throat muscles made learning how to say —ã much less complicated . You could improve your pronounciation of english "one", "with", "wish" etc. You are amazing! 
Thanks so much Very helpful Natalia - this was extremely helpful. I just finished my first lesson in Russian and had a great deal of trouble with this one. However, after your video, I feel like I am beginning to make progress. she's so beautiful This is the learning resource I was looking for. Already subscribed to the channel. You're a great teacher! I have watched a lot of videos online about Russian Pronunciation and yours is the most detailed and informative video I have found, After watching your video and practising I am now able to pronounce the right  "–´" sound, thank you!! So clear, precise and helpful. Brilliant. That was really helpful, thank you ! It's helpful not only for Russian but for other languages that have similar sounds as well. Finally I got it! :-D –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∑–∞ –≤–∞—à–∏ –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ, –æ–Ω–∏ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã –∏ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω—ã, –Ω–æ –±—É–∫–≤—É -–´-, —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ —Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω–æ –≤—ã–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å? Excellent lesson!!! Thank you! This was quite helpful to me! I think part of my problem is that I am not pronouncing the hard consonants hard enough. It is a lot more natural to say –´ once I get the consonant right. It helps to already know the pronunciation of Swedish, English, Irish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and French Just try to imitate Popeye laughing and notice where your tongue goes :p Very helpful, thank you! You've got teaching this sound down to a T, or should I say down to a —ã!
As soon as I made the oo sound my tongue was in the right place for —ã, perfect thanks so much i like that you go in depth with pretty much every single detail, i feel a lot of other peoples videos are rushed through. Thank you very much, it was indeed very helpful, especially comparing the sounds! "–´ is a sound 'ich has no English ekvivalent. It is van of ze most difficult sounds for non-native spiikers"
I love the Eastern European accents so, so very much. This video has just helped me a lot, Thank you very much! yay, mastered it wow this video was so helpful !!! thank you for your help. not confusing.very, very helpful. This was extremely useful. Thanks for your time to make this video. This is a very good video, especially the diagram of the tongue position. ¬†The words you teach in your video are helpful. ¬†However, I'm still having difficultly with words that have —ã but begin with the 's' sound, like¬†—Å—ã—Ä –∏ —Å—ã–Ω. ¬†Would the pronunciation techniques in your video work the same with these two words? Thanks. –ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ everyone. But thanks for this amazing video. I have been learning foreign languages for quite a while, and this one darn letter, –´, has to be one of the hardest struggles that a language speaker will ever face. But your careful guidance, I mastered the letter within the first three minutes! Thank you, thank you so much for this help. +1 subscriber, too. Sound is too bad. Can't learn from this. Thanks this is the best explanation of the¬†—ã ¬†sound. I was really confused for a few days as to how to pronounce it you did an amazing job of explaining it! Your video helped me a lot on the pronunciation of this letter.

Thank you for the videos because I am learning Russian and spanish. I have more experience in Spanish then russian I am an absolute beginner. I hope to be a polyglot like yourself. I want to speak 16 languages in my life. I was wondering how I can acheive this feat? Every time i speak in Spanish I think about conjugating and what tense causing me to fail... I lack confidence and just feel like languages may not be for me... how did you become fluent besides listening to good videos like this? What can I do to be fluent in Spanish and russian. I just want to have a fluent conversation in a foreign language and not stubble over my words... thank you for taking the time to speak with me and I look forward to your response. God bless you.

I‚Äôve subscribed. how can I get this with pdf version. thank you so much for this useful video. Perfect Thanks a lot from Egypt Thank you Kristina. This is a wonderful class for me as a Russian learning student. This video gave me an idea how to teach Japanese, as well. So fantastic. Your teaching style is fun, easy to understand and not fast, great for beginners who are just learning Russian‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüôè I don't like this way of learning.  The russian words are not translated, so you cannot memorise words, which you can use in other phrases. I am starving -in the original is -I (will) die of hunger. These two important words remain hidden behind the translation.
. Dear teacher,

I would like to thank you a lot for your efforts in making these videos. I have subscribed to many Russian learning channels, and all of them are good, but I can say that this teaching style ( repeating, with visual russian subtitles) is the MOST efficient for me. thank you ! Most important phrase in any language 23:55  Thank you so much for your resources! More videos like this please! I love these slow Russian videos. It helps me to clearly hear the entire pronunciation of each word.  Thank you so much! –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ I like all your videos, really good job ...Thumb up üëçüëçüëçüëç Thanks Thaaank yoooouuuu Why can't I make the sounds that are coming out of her mouth? It's like my mouth is broken. I can't even mimic some of the things she says. But I'm not giving up! Very helpful video. Some cartoons that carry easy words for me to understand and practice them every day will be more than welcome. I have nobody to speak with in russian, and as a beginner , it would be good if I can hear simple conversation with simple words I learned so far. Thank you very much A lot of these sentences use "—Ç—ã" (informal) instead of "–≤—ã" (formal/ plural). If you're a beginning learner of Russian, and don't really know any Russians ,wouldn't you more than likely be using the formal form of "you"? Thank you so much for this lesson
–°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∑–∞ –≤—Å—ë‚úç‚úç Russian is my fourth language, and you made me lovin it, less than a month following your channel and I‚Äôm doing good ÈùûÂ∏∏ÊÑüË∞¢ Gracias subir este video.
Aprendi mucho. ‚ò∫ üëç Thanks for another great video. "For me personally", I was not able to work out / comprehend with a few of the (m)(f) phrases if the (m)(f) were referring to the person "saying" the phrase or the person that the phrase was said "to"   Some were OK but others confused me. 


Also, the 100 was a lot            When I tried to go back over it a few times, I was not able to remember them as the gap between first hearing it and hearing it a second  /  3rd  /  4th   time though, was still too much. 


But that is only me, I am a slow learner. I would have loved 20 instead of 100. So, I did 20 then returned to the start then did that a few times and it worked better. Then from 21 to 40, then 41 to 60, then 61 to 80, then 81 to 100. These smaller units were better "for me"   


I have not said that as criticism but to show how the number of 100 can be manipulated to 5 groups of 20. 


But then again, that would have given you "5" separate videos. )))  


I don't know how the youtube payment thing works but hey, if 5 shorter videos gives you more money then great  )))  but if 1 longer video gives you more  then cool  )))
Bottom line. Thanks for another great video I love it, give me more...!!!
The best ...

If you can make some videos with one time in English first then 3 times in Russian that will help a lot when I am in bed learning it without looking at the screen.  For daytime learning it is better to have bigger word font size.   Thank you so much for the slow Russian. Your voice and pronunciation is beautiful.  I will expecting a lot more better videos.

The book is really helping but it is really fast based Are any of these books good for the English speaker who nothing about the language?

Can you or someone recommend a forum to gather general information about travel in Russia? I am planning an extensive overland trip (slow travel with my own vehicle) and will need to know lots of things in advance (for example "how is the cell phone coverage outside cities?") good Is the workbook required or is it optional with the student's book? Also, is there any English in this textbook or is it all in Russian? I speak a slavic language already (serbian) so i know a good amount already, most of the alphabet too! I cant wait to learn russian, its SUCH a beautiful language!! Hello. Thank you so much for your recommendation about the books. Where can I find or rather buy them? Is there anyway to get the answers?? Thank you for your opinions. I am starting from scratch and have been looking for textbooks and this video has helped me. üôèüèæ Why not just sell it in the UK on amazon? Hi there, can we buy the –¢–æ—á–∫–∞ books somewhere please? I live in Louisiana. I had a lot of French courses in school. I've been watching Olena and the jaw harp and Tribal Dance Company. I have a question. I love books, printed books. Here, in America, the younger generation only wants to read on the computer. I still love printed books. How do Russians feel? I hope you can still love printed books too!!! Have a great day. I am curious about Tochka Ru. I am self-studying Russian though. Anyone that has used that book, is it user-friendly enough to be used on your own? i.e. outside of a classroom setting? Well looks like I'll be hittin up Barnes & Noble. Time to get me some Russian speaking learning books. Hi, I'm interesting in learn this language, but I'm Mexican user, so What do you recommend me to reach it? Are there any books for hispanic users?

I've been learning Russian phrases and words through an audio teaching program, but more recently I've changed my learning style and have been trying to learn practicing with native Russian speakers online, and I'm quickly discovering that I don't know how to alter verbs!!! Specifically how they change when you're referring to different subjects, tenses, etc. So I started reading a recommended Russian teaching book that's all about verbs but oh my gosh it's so boring. Conjugated, Infinite, third person past tense, one-stem method, two-stem method. YAWN!!! I feel like my passion for learning is being drained with all these rules. Is there a better way to learn Russian verb alterations naturally, or do I just need to suck it up and get through learning all the rules and grammar of it in my boring textbook? The one I have is called the "Silver Book of Russian Verbs" or something like that. Maybe there are better ones out there that are more... engaging? Greetings! Thanks for your teaching. Sorry I speak very, very little Russian and understand almost nothing. Do you know what bookstores in America might sell or can order those textbooks? I live in state of Missouri. I guess I will have to visit 2 stores here in town of Springfield. Maybe books are only sold in Russia. I am beginner student. If you don't know, thanks anyway. Have a great day.

After case grammar and verb aspects one of the biggest challenges in Russian is the vocabulary. I know there are "frequency dictionaries" where you can see 1000 ¬†most common words, most common 2000, etc. I would love to see readers set to specific levels. One level reader would have only first 1000 words,(first 500 etc) next level would have only top 2000 etc. Also, if you have ideas for any "e books" (Kindle, ¬†and ibook in USA) that would be great . Here you can get the added help of a dictionary (click on the word and get a definition or at least you can copy and paste to something like Google translate). Keep up the good work!

Wonderful russian teacher. Thank you. RU-LAND CLUB - thank you for this lesson!  Stupid question, why yest?'  Yest is eat?  Is this a different form invented precisely because Russian does NOT have "to have," only the (formal as you described) 'possess?'

Brazilian here. Five years ago I would have said this was a good video, but now I see how videos just like this have kept me more confused. The fact is that the phrase "I have" does not exist in Russian language and should not be taught as though it does. You can't just keep memorizing phrases in Russian without any understanding of what is really being said or how people think in Russian. I don't mind watching the video but I have to fix the translation in my mind. I didn't give a thumbs down, but come back after you learn Russian better and you will understand why others also do not like this. Thanks, lady. Please how to say then I will have , you will have ..and I had , you had ? thanks How can Get your first class? Amazing way of teaching....thanks mmmmm BABY; WAnna talk? Thanks a lot Thank youüôè One more video about the verb "have" in Russian: when to omit the verb –ï–°–¢–¨ (in any tense) and what's the difference between "I have" and "–£ –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbwmEMnSBNY&t=799s 
Welcome to watch! :) I'm still a little confused about when to omit –µ—Å—Ç—å.  It seems that if you have an adjective in front of the noun, then you should omit –µ—Å—Ç—å.  So,  —É –º–µ–Ω—è –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞, not  —É –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞.   Is this correct?  Are there any other reasons to omit  –µ—Å—Ç—å? I always love your videos . üòôüòôüòô god! what an astonishing beauty of rusian girls !i was in moscow for 3 monhts but didint meet such a perfect cute comited girl as u ,most girls are alone and dont want to get involved with foreigners, a pity! it was one of my dreams but just diidnt hapen, otherwise i would have risked staying there more time -considering legal issues- cause i coudnt get a job or a studioflat either but wow, what a halucinatory and pretty place it is! i really miss it and sufer my not-so-good luck there! o life! –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ thank you for this video Thenk you so mutch you made me understand better!

I had to collect them before your channel existed by myself but it was worth it. I practiced writing them and after that the language was way way easier to learn. But I didn't treat the foreign words just as a huge group but divided them to smaller ones...foreign words containing only: 1) AKMOT characters, 2) AKMOT characters + having counterparts in English but looks different: b - –± and so on, 3) first + second group characters + for example remaining s characters, etc. –•–û–¢–î–û–ì –ú: –ª–æ–¥–∫–∞ don't speak English Nice ‚ù§Ô∏è I follow  u and i follow every word u speak about ü•∞üòÄ i did in  2 session To learn Russian alphabet you can use Google Translate.

Thank you for explaining the origin of the days of the week, in Russian. –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ  for saying the words slowly I very agree with your method, but I need to tell that mechanic need to "see" (imagine to undersand) the fonction (attribution) of each part, each piece of a motor to correctly rebuilt it. We need to observe not only the "thing", but also the fonction (onction of each part. for instance injection system : imagine the way... from the beginner (entrance, induction) to the abduction). Russian language is very very very "fonctionnal"... it's a real pleasure to listen your "symphonic" voice, it's easier to memorize with you (orchestral conductor). Russian Soul save the deep and best "voice" of each who have "lost" the fondamental "support" (lost "his feet" -balance) . You are so adorable and a good teacher!  Thanks for being awesome. Superb presentation! Your videos are very helpful in learning Russian as beginner. Please continue the good work. Keep it up! Best wishes!!! Thank you for making the words easier to learn Jesus,man isnt she a beauty? same in Arabic, sabit

Thank you Natalia, you're a wonderful teacher. hi natasha if i want to learn russian, what do you recommend to be my first step? thank you!!

great videos by the way very useful!! Interesting, Portuguese days are similar, they're numbered until the weekend when Saturday is named after the Sabbath and Sunday after Lord/God. I guess English is the oddball naming days after Norse gods and planets/Roman gods lol. Your method of association makes it much easier to learn this lesson. Thanks again Natalia. you should smile more. Of course Russians don't like to smile much. I love 3 languages..  English, Deutsche, and Russian.. You are one beautiful Russian lady...and a great teacher. Thanks for breaking down new words by syllable. It's very helpful. This video gives me a hard-on!  Great motivation to learn Russian!  
Sorry, I`m just being honest. ;) hi Natalia I just found you on youtube the other day. This is my third video I am watching after watching the numbers video several times and greetings video. I look forward to watching more of your videos and learning to speak Russian to the Russian  children I teach in the nyc tri state area. why is week Niedƒõla? when nie dƒõlat means not work, we have it as Sunday in czech, because we don't work at sunday :D others are same, and yea week is t√Ωden Thank you, I appreciate when the etymology of the word is given! I like the way that you speak English,it sounds really good,i like your lessons,i want to learn some,you bring a whole new meaning to the word elucidate,excellent, I think you've made the best video here of the Russian names for the days of the week by explaining their semantic origins. This makes it much easier to remember them.

Did you use your bi-directional translation method to learn Russian? 
And how did you write those? Cursive (handwriting), or was it the digital (block letters) that you mainly used or maybe both...?

I found the Cyrillic keyboard quite easy, actually, when I posted a copy of the keyboard viewer handy to my screen. Then as I found the letter and typed it (without looking at the keyboard; I'm a touch-typer), I also sounded out the word. That way I became more familiar with both the typing and the sounds of the letters. Yes, it may be slower at the beginning, but the arrangement of the keys is so much easier to use that I soon caught up. Good Russian...Almost without an accent... Thanks a lot for kind words... Petits conseils pour am√©liorer ta prononciation russe : le —è dans —è–∑—ã–∫ ou —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–æ–π se prononce comme –π–∏, et en plus court. Quand le son –∞ (que ce soit o ou a, par exemple dans –≥–û–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å ou –∑–ê–º–µ—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ) est √©loign√© de deux syllabes, il se prononce comme un schwa. D‚Äôordre g√©n√©ral, l‚Äôaccent d‚Äôintensit√© doit √™tre un peu plus marqu√©, et surtout plus long ‚àí ce n‚Äôest pas pour rien que le ph√©nom√®ne de r√©duction consonantique est si marqu√© en russe, √ßa d√©note une grande intensit√© sur l‚Äôaccent tonique et donc une attention moindre aux autres sons des mots. 
Ne prends pas mal ces remarques, simplement comme je sais que tu es un perfectionniste je pense qu‚Äôelles te seront utiles ;) You look like a Russian when speaking Russian.

It would be nice to watch russian movies with him and talk about them with him in russian Your pronunciation is already close to native, but here are a few tips on how you can improve even further:

- –® and –ñ are actually always hard instead of always soft, which is how you currently pronounce them. I'd say these two consonants are your biggest weakness right now.
- Similarly to the first point, —á and, by extension, —â are also always soft - which goes in stark contrast to Polish, so bear that in mind. –ß should be pronunced similarly to Polish ƒá, while to pronounce —â, you just merge —à and —á together.
- As much as we love to reduce vowels and drop consonants, "—É" actually always stays a vowel, and is never pronounced as as semi-vowel ("w"), which is who you currently pronounce it.

C'e' un canale molto interessante sulla storia della Seconda Guerra Mondiale. In russo, naturalmente)) Si chiama "Tactic Media". I storici di guerra parlano ognuno sulla sua tema on livello davvero profundo e competente. Sono i storici chi studiano i documenti in archivi per anni, non quelli "storici" chi hanno letto un paio di libri populari e fanno dopo le lezioni.

Thank you for the video, Luca! I'm casually learning Russian atm, so this comes at the right time. üôÇ My "trick" to learning the keyboard was to just type all vocab and sentences with a chart of the keyboard layout on screen. Did the same thing with Korean. After a while my brain just gave up and commited it all to (eternal muscle) memory. üòÅ I have question, though: I've been trying to wrap my head around the Russian "R" - so it's trilled, I get that. But it kind of sounds different from e.g. Italian, maybe more like Bavarian? Am I imagining things? (This is not the first time I'm getting confused... actually, if you could one day make a video comparing all the "R" sounds you've encountered so far, that'd be fantastic!) –ó–∞ —Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –í—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –í—ã –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–≥–ª–∏ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è? –ß—É–≤–∞–∫, —Ç—ã –∑–≤—É—á–∏—à—å –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –Ω–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ! –û—á–µ–Ω—å –∫—Ä—É—Ç–æ!

I can't be bothered with the typing on computer (at least yet) so I do it on mobile when I do need to type though I usually prefer using a computer. Some people seemed to talk down on the phonetic keyboard layout, saying that it would not be good for Russian and is kind of like using romanization etc...so I held off. But since Luca does use it and it doesn't seem to hurt his Russian whatsoever, I think I'll just download it. If it's easier, it will only make me want to type in Russian more which is a good thing. Not typing on a French keyboard didn't hurt my French either ;). –í—ã —à–∏–∫–∞—Ä–Ω–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –ø–æ –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏!)

English is not my first language, so i didnt really understand that .. 
Thank you in Advanced Thanks so much for your efforts thanks and keep up why is it that Russians pronounce their –≥ like –≤ for example —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è, –ú–∞—è–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ, etc. I asked my friend this but they couldn't give me a proper answer. When would you know when –≥ sounds like –≤? I recently started learning Russian with the BBC book.  The female speaker on the audio there speaks way too fast and there is no repetition.  Your approach is so much more useful, as it understands the needs of the learner.  By the way I love your accent when you speak English - I wish you would do some audiobooks!  'War and Peace' read by Natalia would be amazing!! üòä thank you!!! You're the best teacher in YouTube. I'm a total beginner in Russian. It will be my fourth language. Your lessons are so helpful. You are one of the best teachers on YouTube.
