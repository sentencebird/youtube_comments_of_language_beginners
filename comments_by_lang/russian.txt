You are a very good teacher and a very beautiful woman. Tanks, also for this video. bol'shoye spaseeba As the native Russian speaker myself, I must correct you: that's a kind of meme now to say that in Russian they used to say "Yes no maybe" (Da nyet navyernoye). In fact though that da in the beginning plays the role of say it intensifier, emotional auxiliary senseless word... What "da nyet navernoye" translates to correctly would be like "Well, no, I think". The word da in Russian language has two meanings, at least. For example, look at da in the phrase "Da budyet svyet" - "Let there be light"... –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç,  –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞! –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ BOL'SHOYE SPASEEBA My name is marina to  USA for listening to you Bol'shoye Spaseeba ‚ô• My friend russian: how are you

with pleasure. I also speak Ukrainian, English and German. I'm very interested in many topics like psychology, education foreign languages, travelling.I really enjoying  interacting with other people. My email is wemilia607@gmail.com. Do you mind to make a few videos to teach us how to pronounce the lyrics for a few famous Russian songs? That would be great and helpful. Songs such as Nightingale https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUtZY0cOnaw   and  Cossack Lullaby https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNhHiKReN48    It is my idea since I love these 2 songs very much and want to learn them.
