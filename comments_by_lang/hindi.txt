Your Video is great as usual. But people are not taking your LAST 10 MINUTES, Seriously. I think you should make a seperate video on it. About Negatives of Meditation. People have suffered in real life.

Agar hum meditation rozana din ko krta hy or jab rat ko sona ho ga to kasa nind aya gi us time ma be banda meditation ma  jaya ga.is condition ma situation difficult ho ga. Sir aise log drink kerke need mai maditaion ker lete hai I have been doing this meditation for only 2 days now , and I herd the central sound and the shankh sound... I am still in shock I don't know what to think of it , I honestly didn't think I would be able to hear it but I did 

I Herd it and  I don't know how to describe my feelings , how I felt when I herd it... 
I am still shocked .. how can 'I' hear it, but I did

https://youtu.be/xnFXxJK3Jsc 😘🙌 💜💜💜💜 Just bak bak bak. Nothing logical. He means that khao, pio, mauz karo... Lekin kese karo koro. Don't do this ,he's simply decreasing the value of your death Wheather this devine sound can be measured in becibel? Silence should not be with any sound to be heard.can,t  we call it sound of solitude? ਇਹ ਇਕ ਓਅੰਕਾਰ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਗੁਰੂ ਗਰੰਥ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਦਾ ਮੰਤਰ ਹੈ What kinda stupidity is this!! Maheshwari doesn't know heck about spirituality and meditation. Stop this ❤😌 thank you so much sir🤍 Thank you sir ☺️ Who didn't find any music within? https://youtube.com/channel/UCD9C7f7aM6oTM1FU27FuJYg Meditation is good everything At the End, Sandeep Sir says that those people who are full of angry, arrogant, cheaters, कसाई, etc. don't do the meditation.
But its wrong, because meditation not only make emotional to the people but also teaches that how to control emotions. Sir earphone ma koe music or frequency sun sakte hai ky Machate raho 🔥 Aasan Hai 🔥 Aisi fillings to gaanja pine ke baad bhi aati hai 😂😂 I want to do meditation so I bought ear plugs but I am not able to insert them 😫😒voice is no stopped I saw many videos on YouTube to insert ear plugs but I can't  ,I think my ears are small to insert it ! M jb bhi aapki vedio dekhti hun mujhy pta nhi q rona aajata h sir orr aapki vedio dekh kr dill sy hasti hun m .rona pta nhi q ata h..😔 Sir aap jis ke bare me bat kar rahe the na ki, Aap duniya se kuch bhi accept kiye bina, Aap unke liye kuch bhi karne ko tyar ho jayenege, Exactly, Mere "Nana" is that same Person.

Dear subscribers, इस वीडियो में 22:49 मिनट में मैंने The (द) - consonant sound  और Thee (दी) - vowel sound लिखने की बजाय गलती से बोर्ड पर इसे उल्टा लिख दिया है, वैसे Examples बिल्कुल सही दिये गये हैं। हमेशा ध्यान रखिएगाः आपको कहना है The (द) अगर consonant sound से अगला word शुरू हो और Thee (दी) अगर vowel sound से अगला word शुरू हो।  प्लीज इस गलती को ignore करिएगा और आप गलती मत करिएगा। - आदित्य सर

That's great Sir I am a new child Sir ye apki video chal nhi rahi hai Mashaallah Thanks 😊 Good job 🙏👌👍🙏🙏 nice Sir y k jo concept bataye h waise toh u k sath v apply ho skta h n ???qki u vowel hai pr kv kv case m consonants k tarh v ho jata h Nice Thank you so much sir 🙏🙏🙏 Sir aap bahut Achcha English padhte ho Sar main Hindi medium ki student hun Meri Thodi English week hai OK 🦋 It is fake Jo log video ko un-like kar rahe hai vo "ham Kuchh zyada jante hai" ye 'khud ko' bata kar santosh pana chahte hai, Negative people hai yaa Trainer se jalte hai. 

Mai English nahi'n janta, lekin itna pata hai ke jo Sikha rahe hai vo positive mind se sikha rahe hai. Unka Dil se Shukriya man'na chahiye. 
Sikhane wala hamesha Guru hota hai chahe kisi se bhi Sikh rahe Ho. 
Jo Kisi Eilm Dene wale ka Adar nahi'n karta vo TaaZindagi Kora hi rahta hai. 

Jab bhi koi sikha raha ho us ka Abhar (shukriya) man'na chahiye. Jaha bhi, Jis se bhi sikhne ko mile, Sikh lo0..! Chahe kisi diwar par hi kyu'n na likha ho!!? 

Mahve Tasbih hi to sab hai magar Idraaq kahaa'n?
Zindagi khud hi Eibadat hai magar hońsh nahi'n..!

In ke kuchh video Maine dekhe, samajh me aate hai. Kabhi kuchh baat samajh nahi'n aati to free time me fir se Dekhta hu'n. 

Agar koi bat samajh nahi'n aati to us me ghalti sikhane wale ki nahi'n. 

Baris sabhi jagah ek si hoti hai lekin pahad us pani ko sambhal nahi'n pata kyo'nki us ka sar Uncha kiya huve hai. Sarkhez Matti bane'n. 
Time tha to likh diya. bura lage vo mujhe bura likh Sakte Ho lekin raat ko Sochna ke aapne sahi kiya yaa ghalat?? 
Positive rahiye.

Regards. When ur a telugu try to learn hindi language When you are a kannadiga and want to learn hindi😨 As an arab, Devanagari letters are hard for me 
So i learned Urdu Hello I am indian and I learn korean but nathing was understand but 
I learn 😂😅🤣 I am learn alphabet but ( ㅇ ) 아 이  but I am not 
Understand what is a means of....... ( ㅇ )   And many things 😟😟😟😟😟 Please can you explain when to pronounce 'v' as 'w' and vice versa? I assumed they were both just swapped over for Hindi pronunciation, but you pronounce the 'v' in DHanyavaaD the same as English, and you pronounce the 'v' in svaagat as a 'w'. 
Is there a logical formula for this or do I have to learn every word?
Thanks When im Filipino trying to learn hindi because my husband is India Why is 60 saath but 7 is saat? I thought 70 should be saath? It seems illogical, unless I'm missing something. Thanks for the video anyway. Very helpful! All those who came here to learn Hindi, all the best.

Hello im a special kid age 23.....im deaf & dumb.... but i want to beome a part of ur compaign.... i want to be a model a actor... i cant speak but i can explain everything through my actions... plz do somthing for our kinda ppl and do support us... thank you 🙏🏻 Silence is a best language You can definitely tell that the person in the video is not deaf and no one that participated in this video is deaf or has family members who are deaf. Who's here to understand permission to dance choreo? 💜 Is your name is Victoria is I am correct or not This video is clearly inaccurate. I have aphasia and I don't recommend anyone to use these signs for the words they show. Mother 
Father
Stser
👩👱👏 Your amazing thank you for doing this language in both ASL and BSL Hey guys,
As a hearing person I am disappointed in the response from the channel after reading the comments section.  However,  instead of not doing anything we can help take this down by reporting this video as misleading to Google.
Pls do this if possible.  Let's stop this injustice to our deaf friends!


After reporting the video it would be great if u would leave a comment showing your support! I don't know anyone deaf but what's the harm if me learning sign language can help someone specially abled mmmmmmmm and I don't know what I did Thank GOD a community of ASL people are here! I would have made a fool of myself Tiene muchos errores las señas thx i want to study sign language in comments everyone says this video is wrong pls give me link or something i need to know sign language ALMOST ALL OF THIS IS WRONG🤬🤬🤬🤬 THIS IS HORRIBLE I HATE THIS TAKE THIS VIDEO OF THE ENTIRE INTERNET NOW🤬🤬🤬🤬 I WAS SO EXITED TO LEARN ASL😭 Incredible video. I've wanted to learn ASL for ages but thought I couldn't. Your video made it so easy. I learned all you taught in less than 2 hrs. THANK YOU!!! What s ASL nd BSL I know nothing about ths Please read comment BEFORE learn. It's wrong. YouTube, please remove this video. https://m.facebook.com/groups/4323268444383910/?notif_t=group_post_no_comment&notif_id=1623462043546115&ref=m_notif #THISVIDIOSUCKS if you think this vidio is inaccurate type #THIS VIDIO SUCKS Me after watching a quiet place Tampa Florida luv They got some right but some wrong for asl i dont know what bsl is so dont go to see this video go to a different one. 0:35 Don't stop...Keep going....Just like that...yeah! we have only being doing asl for a month and we even know that its wrong!!!!! I learned "I love you" from the a quiet placee This video should be deleted I didn't look at the comments before I started memorizing, but I'm glad I saw some other videos before this. I thought something was fishy when the "mother" sign was different from what I've seen. its my pleasure to meet you Victoria I’m  deaf! I like ASL! ASL errors:

Mother (she signed grandmother)
Father (she signed grandfather)
Family ( “BSL” sign for “family” is ASL for “family”)
I am fine (I don’t know if that counts)
I am good (correct sign of “good”: 1:31)
Facebook (We don’t really have a sign for that so we spell “FB”)
YouTube (No. I’m les. Please don’t do that sign for YouTube)
Instagram (We spell “IG”)
What is your name? (she signed name you) Ajtedow Sktrqiyp🍻😡 Skiwovehdv✊ Ahfsvw How to say "options" in sign language I am deaf Please tell what is ASL and BSL 2 years and this video is this up?? I'm not fluent in asl although I definitely know the basics and all of these were COMPLETELY WRONG!! This is spreading misinformation and totally offensive to the deaf community. This is horrible to see Please take this down! The signs are inaccurate That's completely wrong. Take this down now, it’s wrong, please do NOT learn from this not sure for that. This is wrong. I'm not learning of those. I'm hard of hearing and sign language. no. this not how works! *take this down now this isn't you need it!*
i ASL deaf, many signs here wrong. sign social medias do not exist. tamil is the one of the oldest language in the world hello  brothers and sisters why miss the  language 
for tamil Take it down Unfortunately, most of her ASL signs are wrong. is this signs for worldwide? my mind: Learn asl
me: I am not deaf
my mind: *JUST FRICKING LEARN IT!* What os bsl and asl?whats the difference? Hi Viktoria Fake We’re yes and no correct for ASL? In kindergarten we had to use those signs. If yes and no incorrect, I’m very disappointed in my teacher’s knowledge of ASL. Sht and to say I was actually learning this... glad I read the comments after a minute I dont really know why im learning sign langguage its easier ig im new and not deaf my family members are not deaf so idk what im doing may ik whats the different between bsl and asl? Mujee even tho this might be real i dont trust this channel enough *Learn before you teach.* Does anyone which sign language is used most ? I am year 10 old I am deaf! Hi..Iwant to study this..and iWant to communicate With Them. You letter out Facebook, that’s a made up gesture Are P and Q same? WoW Thanks 🙏🏻 I have a question what is the difference between g and p ? What is the dif btwn ASL& BSL? She was signing alphabet to quick for me to catch up It is wonderful Quick question. Does it matter if you do the signs with the left or right hand?
I am a lefty and have been learning the basics, but noticed that I use my left hand to memorize them. Thank you for your efforts
Please, can you give me a list of static(without movement) words of American Sign Language?
Thank you in advance Wait a second I learned really little asl from deaf people and the ones I know are all correct Anyone else did a facepalm after seeing this? She signed GRANDMA and GRANDPA, and the FAMILY incorrectly!!! She I'm so sad, I memorized most of them and then I read the comments. Oh God!! I don’t know anyone who’s deaf 🧏🏻‍♀️ so I don’t know why I like learning sign language 🤟🏻 I really enjoy it I feel like I’m doing an amazing thing 🤷‍♀️ What is ASL and BSL? I learn ASL with my dad he is not deaf but he know it because of his friends I talk sign also xD I only know this by reading the comments , ( thank you for them ) but uhh these are wrong , don’t memorise them please Please, if you are learning asl, DONT use this source, a lot of her signs were wrong or nonexistent. Take this down! It is incorrect So I’m not apparently deaf but I do want to learn it to help some people who ARE deaf like my other lunch lady so I can talk to her<3 Guys just saying shes saying aunt and uncle in the thumnail Some of them are wrong !!! Honestly I memorised one or two for the family and as soon as I read the comments... Disgusting. These are not correct, I have been learning asl Assholes!!! That's all WRONG!!! i was just about to comment to ask something but as i was reading comments of others.. i almost learn from a wrong channel. please if you are not a pro at sign language don't do a tutorial about it many migh learn from this. This is disrespectful to the deaf community Miss... you should prolly take it down. Especially with the “I love you”?🤣 Why she throwing up gang signs GUYS READ THE COMMENTS Most of her ASL signs are wrong😔😔nice class You are very nice😊👍👏 teacher awesome legend Mam, please write letters big size, to enable us to read properly. kbhi socha nhi tha yha ana padega itna gavar hoon mai Ye kia aa eee ooo ho rha hy mjhe kch smjh nahi aa rha A I want to speak hindi and I'm sure one day I speak hindi like pure hindustani I am Karimullah.

krte ho Sir agar mane put buy kiya 9k  ka to mera loss sirf 9k hoge ya usa be uper  options trading me Best Explaination of Call and Put... Thanks 👍 2.5 min over and still at what we are going to learn...bye Bekar beginners lyi ta jma sahi ni very good basic information... sometimes i have seen before the expiry of CALL option ,if we sell and due to expire date reach premium also goes down and one can get profit...   and my query is when we sell CALL or PUT option margin is too high... why so? Watch * 1.75 Not suitable for beginners but intermediate level knowledge of stock markets Sir, in the example; Why are we deciding the profit or loss on the basis of strike price (1cr or 75 lakh)? isn't should be on the basis of change in the premium value (in the example change in the 5lakh)? My buying order rejected mostly why? I am using sharekhan mobile app. Thanks boss clear-cut clarification Thanks sir Video starts from 3:00. Thank me later Nice way to teach. Sob abhi free me detha hey agei bariye 👍 thank you sir i am learning options , am of age 15 , this helped me to understand the concept very well Great बहुत बढ़िया जानकारी भाई साहब। Thank you so much Very well explained.

Kitne simple aur effective way me samjhaya aapne. Thank you sir 🙏🙏 Expiry date par kya call option sell kar sakte hai ? Or primium Kam hone par exit ho sakte hai to kya Mike profit hoga k loss hoga  ,or bank nifty selling ka margin kitna rakhna pada hai ?
Thank you Put buy me  number ager hit hota h or  number se or jda niche aa jta h to munafa hoga m i right Bahut achha se samjhaya apne sir Very easy way to understand the concept...thank you fine sir Sir I buyed 1 Nifty PE  intraday shares in 64 rupees and then it's goes down to 1 rupees so i earn profit or loss please let me know Good 🙏🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍 Explanation in very simple language, very nice sirji. Very helpful clear my some doubt, on what is buy and sell in options segment. Sir . Ur way of explanation is amazing 3.3 why the bald giving example of LAND....give example of company and share... 👍👍 finally i you made me understand Premium ko minus kyun kiya aapne profit me se?🤔
Option me jo profit hota hai wo hai selling price minus premium paid
So according to this profit on home should be 1.25 cr - 1cr = 25 lacs BUY BANKNIFTY 35900 PE ABOVE 330 TRG 590-940 SL PAID
Sir esme 330 kya hai aur 590-940 kya hai samjh me nahi aata hai.. keep it up you have good knowledge Video starts at 3:00 Sir I m new in stock market kya ap data ya chart ke sath example explain kr skte hai 
Aisa kre to hm jaise new users ko jyda help milegi 
🙏 Call n put for any stock also accordingly move like his stock Thanks for sharing valuable information ℹ Sir Jo 10800 se upper call put ka option aata h 
Maan lo mene 10800 pe buy kr liya aur abhi nifty 14500 pe hai 
Toh Mera profit kab hoga jb nifty 14500 se upper jaega tab ya phir jab 10800 pe aayega toh uske baad phir upper jaega toh profit hoga Paper par explain karte toh or bhi aasan hota orally understand nahi hota jitna paper par karke hota hai...👍 डोटटो मै अगर 14200 के strike पर  कॉल ऑप्शन 50 रुपए में लेता हूं एक्सपायरी डेट पर strike प्वाइंट 14210 हो तो मुझे प्रॉफिट होगा या लॉस होगा ??

But you didn't answer one question that you had posted in the last video of the series.
Why would one buy a Future Derivative for a slightly higher price (example of MRF) if they could just buy the stock directly.

Could you tell the reasons or probably mention the video in which the answer could be found.

Please tell me Bad explanation just trying to understand from real numbers. coal India jun 160 ce increased from 5 to 9 today. What does it mean ? People like you deserve much more subs. Hats off. I absolutely agree with the comments below, very clear communication, very well explained, great example, and the best way to learn basics of options. After going through lot of videos finally ur video cleared my doubts...thnx Best explaination ever! Kya mai ye zerodha apps mai kr skta hu Content is good and example are also good in all your videos, but you repeat everything twice which makes it unnecessary long and boring. Also some visuals/ graphic will help to understand the things better. 15500 PE 15600 CE  en dono amount Ka mtlb kya hai sir That’s why I unsubscribed you! One video is linked with other to earn revenue which you can easily explained one or two video! Now you are stretching to video no 3 , I am sure there also u will say — Agle video me -

Brother jo first video ke last me question pe video khtm ki h uska answer to do 🙏 f&O se accha delivery hi kr skte h ? 1.5x pe dekho maja aat Premium amount share ke amount se kam hota h?? Samjho sir me future contract mrf pe kiya then i forgot to sell future contract then what will happen it will add to my Portfolio? After the expire date share sach me portfolio ma add hota hai? I always watch your videos. They are very good . But explanation in this video was a bit fast. पहले वीडियो में जो क्वेश्चन था कि हम फ्यूचर में टोकन  की जगह डायरेक्ट शेयर ही buy क्यों नही कर सकते? इसका आंसर नही दिया आपने। you mentioned rs 20/- as premium amount, what is stock broker asks for more premium to hold options ? how to tackle?Very Nice madam V good not so good teching teacher मॅडम तुमचा नंबर द्या Nice miss Super medam Hhssshs ुुक 👍👍❤️😭😎😎🔥🎉 Very Good Mam and Thanks, but after ga, gha it comes - ang (pronounced as अंग) (before cha, chha),
