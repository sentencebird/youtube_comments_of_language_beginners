PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT MESSAGE:
Dear subscribers, इस वीडियो में 22:49 मिनट में मैंने The (द) - consonant sound  और Thee (दी) - vowel sound लिखने की बजाय गलती से बोर्ड पर इसे उल्टा लिख दिया है, वैसे Examples बिल्कुल सही दिये गये हैं। हमेशा ध्यान रखिएगाः आपको कहना है The (द) अगर consonant sound से अगला word शुरू हो और Thee (दी) अगर vowel sound से अगला word शुरू हो।  प्लीज इस गलती को ignore करिएगा और आप गलती मत करिएगा। - आदित्य सर

Thanks sir Sir please tell me Sir occur meaning Very good explain sir Good morning sir Bahut achha lga sir Sir me English shikhna  Chianti hu  apke  video  ache lage   but itne  sare  videos  h to muje  samj  nhi  aa  rha  kha  se   start           kru  jese.    English          class 1. day   English    class2day Good luck congratulation ji Fantastic Sir य do baar isme hi thoda smjh ni aa rha Si pls pronunciation ka video banaye banaye Assalam o alaikum sir ap mara english language ka murshid Tq sir Live class 🙌 lo sir 🙌 English bolna sikhaye Sir year ke last me ar ka uccharan yar ka kaise hoga so nice vidio sir............
thank you sir................................ That's great Sir I am a new child Sir ye apki video chal nhi rahi hai Mashaallah Thanks 😊 Good job 🙏👌👍🙏🙏 nice Sir y k jo concept bataye h waise toh u k sath v apply ho skta h n ???qki u vowel hai pr kv kv case m consonants k tarh v ho jata h Nice Thank you so much sir 🙏🙏🙏 Sir aap bahut Achcha English padhte ho Sar main Hindi medium ki student hun Meri Thodi English week hai OK 🦋 It is fake Jo log video ko un-like kar rahe hai vo "ham Kuchh zyada jante hai" ye 'khud ko' bata kar santosh pana chahte hai, Negative people hai yaa Trainer se jalte hai. 

Mai English nahi'n janta, lekin itna pata hai ke jo Sikha rahe hai vo positive mind se sikha rahe hai. Unka Dil se Shukriya man'na chahiye. 
Sikhane wala hamesha Guru hota hai chahe kisi se bhi Sikh rahe Ho. 
Jo Kisi Eilm Dene wale ka Adar nahi'n karta vo TaaZindagi Kora hi rahta hai. 

Jab bhi koi sikha raha ho us ka Abhar (shukriya) man'na chahiye. Jaha bhi, Jis se bhi sikhne ko mile, Sikh lo0..! Chahe kisi diwar par hi kyu'n na likha ho!!? 

Mahve Tasbih hi to sab hai magar Idraaq kahaa'n?
Zindagi khud hi Eibadat hai magar hońsh nahi'n..!

In ke kuchh video Maine dekhe, samajh me aate hai. Kabhi kuchh baat samajh nahi'n aati to free time me fir se Dekhta hu'n. 

Agar koi bat samajh nahi'n aati to us me ghalti sikhane wale ki nahi'n. 

Baris sabhi jagah ek si hoti hai lekin pahad us pani ko sambhal nahi'n pata kyo'nki us ka sar Uncha kiya huve hai. Sarkhez Matti bane'n. 
Time tha to likh diya. bura lage vo mujhe bura likh Sakte Ho lekin raat ko Sochna ke aapne sahi kiya yaa ghalat?? 
Positive rahiye.

We subscribed to your channel Tq sir 🤗 'main' and 'hai' often sounds to me as 'meh' and 'heh'. I've thought these writing method was to show as close as possible to the English language. Do native speakers feel those sound as 'meh-in' and 'heh-yeeh' actually? https://youtu.be/gS1LlfatuXo Wow really thank you from Myanmar kya likha hai I have been looking for this for so long.
