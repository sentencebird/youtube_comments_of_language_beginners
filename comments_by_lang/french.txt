Learn French in 5 days ? Seriously lol what's the difference between this and version 2? Brasil? Alguém? Damnn 4 hours of free and top notch content!!! Preach to you teacher <3 !!! This is one of the best, if not the best, comprehensive videos on the French language I've ever seen..I'm living in France for 18 years Merci Fantastic Big Bro 👌 Fabulous video https://youtu.be/5y5gPRPMf6g Vincent if I had you as my french teacher in high school I'd be more fluent in french than my native language. Having left high school some 37 years ago. I am so excited to have found your channel. Hoping to visit my friend in Quebec after covid has subsided this is an awesome resource to get me back in shape. A million thanks. French has always been my 2nd language growing up back home,but living in Australia 🇦🇺 most of my life I’ve forgotten so much, but I’m so happy to hear it again, and you’re right instead of 5 days it actually took me 2 days to speak French without throwing in English words.!!
Thank you so much 😊 
I used to teach my son when he was younger,, so I shared this video with him, and he too find it so easy to catch up where he left off.! 
We agreed to speak French from now on so we don’t forget again.!!

My channel is fairly new and it needs your support to grow!  😀 Merci à vous pour  cette vidéo 15:39 🤣😂 The masculine/feminine word distinctions are very challenging. Does it mean the French Language has two versions of every single word? really easy to understand, I learn a lot. :) I like the way you teach, you go through every words and explained it very well on the proper pronunciation, the grammar, etc. not just a flat reading from a translated english sentence where in it is hard to catch up. a little background in spanish also helps. merci and more power! Is this video sufficient to learn French

(Joel 2:12-13 [KJV]) +++++ Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

Excellent! wow french pronunciation is harder than english pronunciation. french words pronunciation are not consistent with the pronunciation of the alphabet letters like english or spanish words do. a lot of words with mute sounds and words that sound quite diferent as they are written. my friend would it be posible to include the written pronunciation as it might sound close to an english or spanish word pronunciation it will help a lot. https://youtu.be/MUopWpXLm0U https://youtu.be/5NWe1HLacGk 34:51 Don’t mind me, I’m just keeping my place for when I come back uwu Could you make a Québécois very of this L' alphabet - 0:00

day 1: 24:57
day 2: 41:33 New subscriber here. This is very helpful indeed. Cheers! Hi Vincent great video. Will it help in my DELF B1/B2 test? I mean, is that all the grammar I need to know?? 1:17:18 using a time stamp for myself lol Whats the difference between 1s-3s and 1p-3p 7 minutes in was so very helpful! I simply could not figure out the pattern using Rosetta Stone as they don't explain anything. It's a great learning tool except for the grammar part is lacking in my opinion. I simply con't just figure it out with pictures alone. Now I understand. Thanks so much! Vincent, I can't thank you enough for your work here.
It has been more than a week since I started to learn french again since high school and you did an amazing job at explaining basic grammar for a beginner. I took notes of everything you mentioned here and now I am moving to your next video "Learn French in 5 days".
My goal is to learn french within 6 months at B2 level, until then "au revoir". 35:04 30:32 This is a great Video. Merci beaucoup! 35:17 IM USING THIS AS A TIME STAMP FOR MYSELF Merci Professeur,  la prochaine fois, veuillez montrer une nouvelle vidéo . This video is a lifesaver!!! Very very useful video thank you so much vicent i am learing french so fast with your videos and with Duolingo app , french music etc etc . Can you do a 2020 version of this video. Merci beaucoup support from kosovo 🇽🇰 Merci Timestamps would be nice... There are several components to how to talk French online . A resource I found that succeeds in merging these is the Magic Language Method (look for it on google) definately the most useful remedy that I have ever heard of. Check out the extraordinary information . Best vdo I have ever seen I have been taking ten minutes every day so that way I don’t overload myself. This is really helping me! 0:11

Thank you Vincent 😆 My favourite thing from this video is the "BYE BYE" Merci oK aNd ThEn Not to be dramatic but I would die for this man if youre looking for talking like, idk how to decribe it, "high french"? its like the best possible version of french, should you connect word in snetnces ( 01:22:00 ) or leave it and say each word seperately???? Rubbish, Not complete, only stuck with present tense Why after  1:28 you started putting already used content? https://youtu.be/mm5CCw7NeuY Thanks good Merci Vincent.

27:37 nice lecture It’s really a good video that each part not so long. But sometimes I don’t know what the sentence means, I think it would be better to make a English translate near the French sentence. Hope you a beautiful day. 💛 Waaait a moment! What an earth is going on at 51:54? When the video ends, a picture of an old desktop shows up briefly, and to my astonishment the button in the bottom left corner is in Finnish. (KÄYNNISTÄ) Im not sure what is going on here anymore. :D Anyway, good content. There are  several ideas for how to learn French
Decide exactly why you wish to learn it
Try to speak French everyday
Find which method works for you the best.

Mi manchi tanto... And am all here learning what to tell him in return 🤗🤗🤗 I came here to learn italian, just like ezio auditore I’m actually learning Italian for my second language! I already know some but my favorite phrase is “odio la coronavirus” it means I hate coronavirus Mamma mia🇮🇹 It's so funny language but also difficult to me 😄 charming! Ohh I know when ill be using "Ti piace!?" I had a Sicilian friend who was teaching me but he left the country 😒 I can talk a little but can't write... I know Italian and I am learning Spanish and learning Spanish when you do know how to talk Italian really helps! It's so pretty. I'm Italian and... I don't know why I'm here
Maybe because I love to hear my language spoken by strangers
Anyways great vid Wow😃 Okay I literally just came here so I could talk to myself on Italian and everyone would be like ‘what?’ Jojo fans i know ur out there somewhere watching these vids :) Very nice. It's very similar to romanian! All I hear is "Antonio Marga-riti, Antonio Marga-reeeeeiiiiiiiiti, Margheriti!" One month into quarantine now im trying to learn Italian I thought that Grazie was in spanish😂😂 Acá vengo yo a ver que honda con este idioma the pronunciation is wonderful. Im starting to learn Italian language over corona virus Just getting started.  It’s fun so far Top language up there with french Grazie :) 3:02 The most beautiful language in Europe Thank you it was so useful 🇮🇹 Ok im romanian and its very very similar to it!!! THE BEST LEARNERS VIDEO EVER!!

Mi piace 👍 I’m English and can also speak fluent german... are there any Italians out there that would like to learn English or German and could help me with Italian in return? This is one of the best page ever 17 minutes feel like 1 hour if you take your time learning and writing italian/english so will the Italians make fun of me when I can’t roll r’s twice in one word? Paraskeuas re Grazie✌ fuck sakes, i can't roll my tongue like that Thank You! Finally a course that truly starts out slowly and carefully! Arrivederci I'm trying to learn Spanish and Italian at the same time 🤣🤣 so with my little knowledge in Spanish I can understand most of the Words in that list! (BTW I'm French and some words are the same but not the prononciation, it's confused me sometimes ) Ciao 👋🏼 Buona sera If my name is an actual word would I pronounce it Italian? I am not Italian but I love this anime which one of the parts is set in Italy, and I thought it be cool learning Italian. Come si chiama? Formal

Come ti chiami? Informal Learn Italian Words (2018) I’m learning this because of a YouTuber called Davie504 and he is Italian Please more video Grazie di tutto 🙏🏼 I've known French and Spanish for years. Stared learning Italian about a week ago. My previous studying of French and Spanish is very helpful as the words are so similar. I looked at some basic words. Italian colours resemble the French words while Italian body part names resemble the Spanish. If I picked an unrelated language to learn like Russian, Chinese, Indian or Hebrew then I'd be studying way harder. There'd be no clues whatsoever. Diciamo che un ragazzo ti parlo e dire che lui è solo ma lo piacci.

Don't mind me just practicing my Italian I so wanna go to Italy. I wanted to learn it for fun and I learn something new thank you You see, if my school offered decent italian classes me learning wouldnt be a problem are you itailan? Voglio meno is useful, usually as Italians we serve a lot of food like 10x more than average, honestly When your family is from Italy but you were born in America so u don’t know Italian فتت بدافع الفضول Me pare che uno deve prima imparare l'italiano per dopo insegnarlo. When you are Somali and you see italian language as your mother language because Somali and italian have the same words. I can learn italian language just for 3 months.😂 perfetto Sto ballando... Sto cantando... Stai contando... Stiamo camminandoMine too it is really clear Merci ok Thanks You are  going so fast contnuo the video cool Bonjour tout le monde!

But it's even more beautiful to listen to. Thank you for helping me finally make some progress on something I've been procrastinating. You have a very entertaining and engaging way of teaching. ❤️❤️❤️ Can you please speak faster you fool? It's beginner, but you speak too fast so people don't have enough time to repeat it to try to remember it. Je m'appelle Arpita.. For a minute I thought I was listening to a Japanese person.
I'm not sure if it is me, but a lot of french words sound the same, like voice, want, see, and I think there are others, so actually hearing someone say those words a loud might be helpful.
I'm not sure how useful or easy it would be to just learn french like this, but it is fun to listen to her talk. it's like talking with a friend; 
I think that's what makes this work, I learned a new word: "doux". 8:19 . Vraiment mignon 😍😍. Tout.... tellement mignon Kiss You in HAND MY QUEEN what does "Mundo" mean?

If you know Ajjubhai from free fire, just reply Noice. i speak arabic and french letters are easy pronunviation to me lmao I regret I took French😂 (so confused 🤷‍♀️) L sounds lighter than English l So E sounds like Azerbaijani ö ( like English [ ɜː] ) , u sounds like Azerbaijani ü, like German ü in züss. Then it must be easy for them to pronounce my name Könül (for French speakers Kenul ) which means heart, soul. This is kinda a bit easier for me as a person who speaks norewgian because the e sounds like ø and the o sounds like å My child is learning French in his school.

Who's here to understand permission to dance choreo? 💜 Is your name is Victoria is I am correct or not This video is clearly inaccurate. I have aphasia and I don't recommend anyone to use these signs for the words they show. Mother 
Father
Stser
👩👱👏 Your amazing thank you for doing this language in both ASL and BSL Hey guys,
As a hearing person I am disappointed in the response from the channel after reading the comments section.  However,  instead of not doing anything we can help take this down by reporting this video as misleading to Google.
Pls do this if possible.  Let's stop this injustice to our deaf friends!


After reporting the video it would be great if u would leave a comment showing your support! I don't know anyone deaf but what's the harm if me learning sign language can help someone specially abled mmmmmmmm and I don't know what I did Thank GOD a community of ASL people are here! I would have made a fool of myself Tiene muchos errores las señas thx i want to study sign language in comments everyone says this video is wrong pls give me link or something i need to know sign language ALMOST ALL OF THIS IS WRONG🤬🤬🤬🤬 THIS IS HORRIBLE I HATE THIS TAKE THIS VIDEO OF THE ENTIRE INTERNET NOW🤬🤬🤬🤬 I WAS SO EXITED TO LEARN ASL😭 Incredible video. I've wanted to learn ASL for ages but thought I couldn't. Your video made it so easy. I learned all you taught in less than 2 hrs. THANK YOU!!! What s ASL nd BSL I know nothing about ths Please read comment BEFORE learn. It's wrong. YouTube, please remove this video. https://m.facebook.com/groups/4323268444383910/?notif_t=group_post_no_comment&notif_id=1623462043546115&ref=m_notif #THISVIDIOSUCKS if you think this vidio is inaccurate type #THIS VIDIO SUCKS Me after watching a quiet place Tampa Florida luv They got some right but some wrong for asl i dont know what bsl is so dont go to see this video go to a different one. 0:35 Don't stop...Keep going....Just like that...yeah! we have only being doing asl for a month and we even know that its wrong!!!!! I learned "I love you" from the a quiet placee This video should be deleted I didn't look at the comments before I started memorizing, but I'm glad I saw some other videos before this. I thought something was fishy when the "mother" sign was different from what I've seen. its my pleasure to meet you Victoria I’m  deaf! I like ASL! ASL errors:

Mother (she signed grandmother)
Father (she signed grandfather)
Family ( “BSL” sign for “family” is ASL for “family”)
I am fine (I don’t know if that counts)
I am good (correct sign of “good”: 1:31)
Facebook (We don’t really have a sign for that so we spell “FB”)
YouTube (No. I’m les. Please don’t do that sign for YouTube)
Instagram (We spell “IG”)
What is your name? (she signed name you) Ajtedow Sktrqiyp🍻😡 Skiwovehdv✊ Ahfsvw How to say "options" in sign language I am deaf Please tell what is ASL and BSL 2 years and this video is this up?? I'm not fluent in asl although I definitely know the basics and all of these were COMPLETELY WRONG!! This is spreading misinformation and totally offensive to the deaf community. This is horrible to see Please take this down! The signs are inaccurate That's completely wrong. Take this down now, it’s wrong, please do NOT learn from this not sure for that. This is wrong. I'm not learning of those. I'm hard of hearing and sign language. no. this not how works! *take this down now this isn't you need it!*
i ASL deaf, many signs here wrong. sign social medias do not exist. tamil is the one of the oldest language in the world hello  brothers and sisters why miss the  language 
for tamil Take it down Unfortunately, most of her ASL signs are wrong. is this signs for worldwide? my mind: Learn asl
me: I am not deaf
my mind: *JUST FRICKING LEARN IT!* What os bsl and asl?whats the difference? Hi Viktoria Fake We’re yes and no correct for ASL? In kindergarten we had to use those signs. If yes and no incorrect, I’m very disappointed in my teacher’s knowledge of ASL. Sht and to say I was actually learning this... glad I read the comments after a minute I dont really know why im learning sign langguage its easier ig im new and not deaf my family members are not deaf so idk what im doing may ik whats the different between bsl and asl? Mujee even tho this might be real i dont trust this channel enough *Learn before you teach.* Does anyone which sign language is used most ? I am year 10 old I am deaf! Hi..Iwant to study this..and iWant to communicate With Them. You letter out Facebook, that’s a made up gesture Are P and Q same? WoW Thanks 🙏🏻 I have a question what is the difference between g and p ? What is the dif btwn ASL& BSL? She was signing alphabet to quick for me to catch up It is wonderful Quick question. Does it matter if you do the signs with the left or right hand?
I am a lefty and have been learning the basics, but noticed that I use my left hand to memorize them. Thank you for your efforts
Please, can you give me a list of static(without movement) words of American Sign Language?
Thank you in advance Wait a second I learned really little asl from deaf people and the ones I know are all correct Anyone else did a facepalm after seeing this? She signed GRANDMA and GRANDPA, and the FAMILY incorrectly!!! She I'm so sad, I memorized most of them and then I read the comments. Oh God!! I don’t know anyone who’s deaf 🧏🏻‍♀️ so I don’t know why I like learning sign language 🤟🏻 I really enjoy it I feel like I’m doing an amazing thing 🤷‍♀️ What is ASL and BSL? I learn ASL with my dad he is not deaf but he know it because of his friends I talk sign also xD I only know this by reading the comments , ( thank you for them ) but uhh these are wrong , don’t memorise them please Please, if you are learning asl, DONT use this source, a lot of her signs were wrong or nonexistent. Take this down! It is incorrect So I’m not apparently deaf but I do want to learn it to help some people who ARE deaf like my other lunch lady so I can talk to her<3 Guys just saying shes saying aunt and uncle in the thumnail Some of them are wrong !!! Honestly I memorised one or two for the family and as soon as I read the comments... Disgusting. These are not correct, I have been learning asl Assholes!!! That's all WRONG!!! i was just about to comment to ask something but as i was reading comments of others.. i almost learn from a wrong channel. please if you are not a pro at sign language don't do a tutorial about it many migh learn from this. This is disrespectful to the deaf community Miss... you should prolly take it down. Especially with the “I love you”?🤣 Why she throwing up gang signs GUYS READ THE COMMENTS Most of her ASL signs are wrong😔😔Bonjour.

I'm the 1111th comment hello am amaze to be in your French class and i really want to learn and improve on it 1 question can we slow down the timer please Me: My dad keeps pushing me, I just don't get how to say some words correctly

Moi: Je suis beaucoup mieux Français je vous remercie beaucoup Ouino (English form) I am much better at French thank you very much Ouino.
Ouino: aucun problème (English form) No Problem This is so good for kid Merci beaucoup, vous parlez très lentement. C'est très bien. C'est gentil.👍 Je suis cambodgienne et j’aime bien français mais je ne peux pas utiliser tous les jours parce que à mon travail ni person qui parle français Merci beaucoup Thanks Make the vdio on use of aux. Ah oui? Felicitation. Merci beaucoup 🙏 funny how these vids help more then school lol One of best video I came across building basic conversations in French Is there a Chinese Ouino? I am just at the stage when I need to hear spoken french without it being part of a lesson, but am unable to understand proper conversations. This is perfect! Thank you! Very good Hey Ouino how did you get our gmail? If you would have added English Sentences in audio. So we could listen while doing other activities too. This video is really helpful. Thank you Directions 40:00 Now haters will say it's 1hour 4 second long ಠ_ಠ Thank you for offering this free intro to Ouino French. I was puzzled about the course strategy after listening to the first short conversation that goes for the normal speed with liaison then slower speed to individual words. Anyway, the contents are very practical and useful. Thanks. What does vns means in French? "Quelques-vns ne la divisent qu-en deux fortes de Peuples, en Turcomans, & Curdes" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Merci , c’est très facile 🌹😍 best french lesson so far! It runs in the backround everyday,  C'est super :) Je vais travellier, bonjourneé monsieur/ monsieur. Au revoir! I can't get enough of you guys hihihi 😂 Wawo i like this thanks and keep it up I dont get a single word when they speak at normal speed 😅 It's  great  just  loving it Very good.Thank. waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaa It's  amazing  you speak  slowly  this will  help  me  while my school  close This is very helpful along with Forvo where I learn vocabulary & pronunciation with digital French flash cards. This is helpful for French students like me who sorta struggle in the listening department I love French language  ....but need to learn..☺ I am trying to learn french.  I am pulling my hair out!  Seems to me they took an excellent language (Latin) and went lazy on it.  Example: 'court' (cour), running, a single person.  This is very close pronunciation to the Latin corrit (pronounced corrit).  Multiple people running in french is courtent, prounced (cour).  WHAT!!?!?!?!?!  This is very close in spelling to the Latin corrent (pronounced corrent).   How do you ever tell what is singular and what is plural.  And what is with all the letters at the ends of the words that are just ignored.  It must be a nightmare to understand the spelling.  Might have to go back to Spanish, it has some strange stuff (ll, and useless h's) but not like French. Good! Très bien! Merci beaucoup. Very thanks! Tres bien Just great...I'm 68 and always wanted to learn French...when i was in high school we didn't have such learning tools. So thankful for this computer and all these videos...Also the website "italki" Oh great, I love it so much and thank you. learn french  very hard  , i want learn  French, please  help any one Wow.

HARMANE HARMANER DE CARCAFE this guy speaks so fast from the very beginning it's hard to follow Merci Monsieur ça va  🇫🇷👍 Love the French accent. :) Something interesting I've just noticed: when I first saw this video a while back, I always thought Darta said "ciao" as a pun, considering this was a video about French so the first word she would say was Italian as a soft banter to screw around. I now realise that "Ciao" is an actual real word in Latvian (Darta's language) which means hello lmao 1:40, that woman from Easy german drinking Vodka LOL darta means fart in arabic I didn't like it so much, it seems to be messy - going in  random directions, and certainly not super easy for complete beginners. ok i ship him with Darta Who the hell invented this language?? wonderful lesson, thanks from Brazil For a dummy like me, this is a fun video to help learn French. My lockdown goal to learn a language has begun! So why exactly is the playlist in reverse order? It makes it impossible to play. Merci le petit! it looks like all the girls are crushing on him 🤣 Legendary His other videos are fast  as compared to this one.seems like he wanted to talk fast, pointing less and repeating less Merci beaucoup 🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩😍 merci beacoup! saludos desde california I feel so dumb right now🤣 why "Qui est-ce" and not "Qui est" ? This was really fun!! Thanks! Fantastic and lovely presentation Friend obrigado 
Thanks for excellent video What's the difference between madmoissele and demoissele "Est-ce que tu parles français?"
Kes kusse, kes ku jua haha, you both are really cute and funny. Good job! Anyone here from french classes? That was really nice Extremely cute, natural, inspiring. Gonna to show it to my 6-year-old son, studying French! He will love it more, than horribly-colored cartoons. Darta es muy guapa. Awesome 😂 Thanks a million bro mi parli piano Could you speak a little slower, because I cant ...... VIVAN LOS NOVIOAS CAHABALES HAS LIOOOOO
HOY SE F0LL3 What a lovely concept!.. Thanks for the lessons!! Thank a lot for your efforts, continue doing similar videos. Why did I think of David Bowie 😅 absolute beginners *s c h o o l* Nice video France language Learn how to introduce yourself in French : https://youtu.be/Tn0OxEkJcSU Вау класс French is too difficult That french R is a joke. I just can't make that sound as an American. It's pretty but throaty,  thick, and above all hard as hell. How important is mastering the french R sound and what if I suck at it.

Also are you dating Darta? Lmao!! I am never going to be able to learn French LOL 😊 🤷‍♂️I have been studying it non-stop since middle school! 🤦‍♂️ A Brazilian speaker trying to learn french with english subtitles.. jesus help Merci 👏👏👏 I feel like being 3 years old and watching my dad teach me how to speak 🕺 💃 Brilliant Where has your video gone for asking directions??  I need it for my teaching! Most useful video for learning French I’ve seen yet! I love how it incorporates daily life into the learning making it so much easier to pick up and retain. I love it!! vous êtes très drôles :D C'est super! Merci, c'est une bonne chance à pratiquer la langue. merciii Cette dé ouvre mon coeur 4:29 Omg it's so difficult 🙄 This is NOT a lesson for beginners!!!! Super!

Thank you very much, Sir.
Bucuresti, RO, UE Merci beaucoup you are appreciated my brother. thank you. Спасибо за уроки, они просто замечательные! i think it would be much useful if you could show us what shape the mouth makes while pronouncing the vowels. I feel like A and E are the same; like same sound but one is higher and another one is deeper. I dont know if that makes any sense. merci infiniment Please you can speak German is a good He is video 📹 is very nice Thank you very much  for French learning French Anyone in 2018? Merci beaucoup, c'est très bien pour moi. 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘 How do I get in touch with Vincent Thanks supersin cok sey ogretiyorsun cok tesekurler selam You are amazing! I listen to your lessons everytime I have a break at work. You are a very good teacher, you explain the things clearly and make everything easier. I also love your pronounciation. Thank you a lot! Merci beaucoup!🙏🏼 omg 8 hours how much effort was put in this video French isn't as difficult as everyone thinks we learn French in the third year of primary school Is it just 6 units for beginners, or which videos goes next?? I am interested in why you broke with your tradition of presenting examples for Masculine, Feminine, and Plurals in your "Les demonbstrufs"  lesson. As you omit the Plurals. in "expression de la quantite" you have suddenly decided not to give any example sentences/ I think this is a mistake. You should continue to do  this a a good procedure for presentation of new information. Secondly you call attention to the noun being "sans article". If I think about a sentence in English, I don't feel a need for an article. So there must be a reason why you call attention to this matter. When you call attention to a point in your presentation  you should explain it, because certainly the listeners will question your emphasis. It is not good teaching practice "to leave issues hanging". You forgot to add "pas" after the verb, or you didn't explain why it is omitted your video is the best on net thank you very much. just at first when you teaching give us more example for beginners many thanks mate. your video is the best on net thank you very much. just at first when you teaching give us more example for beginners many thanks mate I notice that beginning with the leson "Les questions" you stop pointing out the leisons between spoken words beginning with vowels. As a new student, I think this is a pity that you decided to do this, as I need some help in this area because I am a new learner. IF I were studying at a higher level this could be taken for granted, and it would save your voice as well not to need to mention this spoken linking. Bonjour Monsieur, Cette leçon 1,2,3,4,5 et 6 J'ai très bien compris, parce que j'ai déjà étudié en Inde, mais j'ai bien étudié à DEFI. Maintenant, je peux écrire 95 persent. Ce mot tous en français. Merci beaucoup Monsieur. bonsoir, vincent! I'm trying to learn french on my own - without classes or teachers - and this video is really helping me. thanks! MAGNIFIQUE! There's a Thai girl who is gorgeous and sexy she wanted to date me. Don't know how I neglected her.  She's sexy hot. I would never be able to finish this ugggh!! hello vicent.

How would you pronounce my name Monserrat in French ? I am from Egypt and your videos helped me a lot thanks :) Hello Vincent
Please use english words / sentences along with the french words or sentences that you use here as an example.
Your examples are very clear , but it will help to see english letters/ sentence along s with your french letters/ words... which will help create a picture in mind and relate them together.
Inspite of me finding it a little difficult to follow without the english words, i still find your videos are the best among others that are available in Youtube.
Thank you for your videos, however hoping to get something i am looking for. Thanks for the video. It helps. Thank you very much . I found it most easy way to learn  French . Vincent vous offrez des skype lecons? si oui, combien euro? désolé pour moi mauvais français lol I'm really appreciate with your French lessons. It's very helpful. I'm a beginner level, just started learning. It would be very kind of you if you could make a video of French pronunciation that we could see your mouth's movement and transcription at the same time. I can hear you pronouncing but I still have trouble moving my mouth. Anyway I'll try my best. Thank you so much. :) j'adore votre methodologie d'enseignement Mr V Danke schön! Thank you so much for this tutorial, it helped a lot! ^^ Merci pour cette vidéo. Je l'utilise pour me réviser, ma langue française. Bonjour Vincent! Thank you for all our time and dedication in sharing this beautiful language without expecting any returns. Merci beacoup! merci beaucoup Is there a lot of differences between the French spoken in French and Quebec? BTW, this is very helpful merci beacoup! :) How would you say Zoe in French I'm trying to piece it together thank you, very very good :) (y) I am very passionate to learn different languages and want to be able to speak french fluently , i have searching for means for that and somehow i ended up here and only thing i find troublesome is , the videos are extremely lengthy also you jump from one lesson to another, i don't understand where to use those Accents that i just learned, like i need more examples to what , why and how! please don't take it personal i m eager to know more and more, need more help than i can get. 5-12 very good sir, u r help a lots you are good..but french is too complicated :( You are the best! Thank you so much for your videos In my French class we learned "y" as "i grec " why wasn't it included here? excelentee!! The tutor does not say the English meaning of the words in maximum cases.. So over all its a good effort tutorial ...  Its good to learn how to make the pronunciation mainly rather than learning new sentences and words... This could have been a very good tutorial... I hate when you talk alot someone please help me understand. what is the difference between using moi, toi, lui etc and using me, te, le/la pronoms COD?  I don't get it. if you know, will you please really break ot down for me. thank you! This will be a great chance to practice my French! Now I have a motivation to learn it,because I am studying in university and there is an "Erasmus" programme that lets students come to other countries to study in their universities! And now I've met an interesting French girl so it will be more interesting to try talk to her in French. Of course,she understand English,but not as well as French.  Merci! merci ;) niceIt is the pronunciation I can’t learn Spanish so I’m learning French I guess Very informative. I am learning French in school. It helps. Merci.....

Great  programe even for  recreational or tertiary support ,I am very much impressed. Suis-je le seul ici pour qu'ils puissent améliorer notre français Merci ❤️ That was so Amazing I dont understand French and I never want to learn it. im glad because its an absolutely imperialistic country, and its shameful how they invaded and drove to extinction all the native culture and languages of the people whom they conquered, mostly assimilated in current France. French is not native to even 50% of the french territory, yet they ensure it is the countries language, while the actual original languages of current French land are treated as "non-existant" by France. Also, their speakers have no rights, only the right to shut up and become extinct. This is a cultural and linguistic genocide, still going on nowadays, and almost completed by "France". They just made sure by force, law, the media and the French state to eradicate their languages and cultures. Thats a true cultural and linguistic genocide, what the french carried out and still carry out nowadays. I laugh at the equality principle in France, sure were all equal as long as u speak French and abandon the original culture of ur own land and people, so u can become fully assimilated by France. I hope the day comes when France gets judged for the cultural and linguistic genocides it carried out within its borders. They almost drove to extinction occitan, alsacian, corsican, basque, catalan and breton in France, the original language spoken in the lands they now inhabit and whose people have by force and pressure abandoned their forefathers culture and language. Completely assimilated their people by the force of law and making they feel inferior for not as quoted "being clean & speaking french". Shame to France! Please show respect and learn the original languages of the land which u invaded and whose people u mistreated, to amend for ur crimes. Ill never learn such a disgraceful language as I think France is a disgraceful country. Même si je suis français j’arrive pas à savoir 😭 So easy methods to learn french merci Great video.❤️❤️.I'm a teaching French by giving simple tips..will cover everything from basic to advance..cya❤️ wow this so cool and understanding They have expression unlike other french videous XD These loud conversations in the library are disturbing me from practicing  moi français lol Muito Obrigada pelos vídeos.

BEST LETTER EVER Hi! I'm french and I'd like to have a swap (I guess it's the good Word) with an english pupil who wants to learn french. Are you interested in ?  It's very useful   Cheers mate Great lessons. Really helpful. Thank you. Thanks for the video. Its very well done and very helpful. Thanks a lot,i don't know french and i had french exam tomorrow and i was scared ,but thanks to this video,i was able to understand french.Merci.!!!  :) @Žigan krajnčan   you helped me to finish my school! 1love man! you are a great teacher ! thanx alot ,,,,, God Bless you wow 5 hours Excelente material. Gracias. Great video, great teacher. great tip for making the correct "u" sound is making a "u" sound and "oooh" sound at the same time. Why would he not put the English there to explain what it means though. I feel like I'm learning french words without the meanings. Unless that happens later. the way you said ''www'' made me watch my lang more! :)) mercii <3  btw just one tip to people who learn french as second language, its that don't go hard on urself, i mean i've seen some of my friends learning french they kind a like make this weird face to get the accent, just try to make it normal, you have to make it very simple by not making sound so difficult, its actually easy if u get it once! u can do it! :)) lol im french but idk how 2 speak it

Merci beaucoup for this video 🙏👌👍☺😊🇫🇷♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ As a french I would say that the word "Beautiful" would be better translated as "Magnifique" than belle. And as for the words "Belle and Beau" they would be better translated as "pretty" . ✌🏻 We do need genders! But what did April and August do to be cooler than the rest of the months Thank! Merci beaucoup~🥰 cette vidéo est très très utile.~ 😀 Please put the article with the nouns so help me learn if it’s masculine or feminine. I wish someone  could teach us in hindi...😅🤗😁 Where are the articles of the words Lady voice sounds Chinese best of all is to smoke sofa 200 english words but french is less. As magasin- shop and store, chambre - bedroom and room. 3:00
Btw guys, pouvoir is a verb. Not the object. This ain't what we need.

1. We need the articles so we know the gender of the words.
2. These ARE NOT useful words. We need to know the 200 most useful words that we'd use every day. I'm pretty sure air conditioner ain't one of those. i learned that in speaking french you need to learn how to speak cursive Appreciate you handwork, but next time please mention the gender, it makes it even better and helpful! lol This is not a good dictionary. They did not include articles. This will not help develop proper understanding of genders This is not a good dictionary. They did not include articles. This will not help develop proper understanding of genders This is not a good dictionary. They did not include articles. This will not help develop proper understanding of genders This is not a good dictionary. They did not include articles. This will not help develop proper understanding of genders This is not a good dictionary. They did not include articles. This will not help develop proper understanding of genders Bathroom - toilet يعيو merci d'avoir expliqué ☺☺☺☺ Me: As long as I don`t develop an accent and fuck up vowels I will be safe in any language
French: allow me to introduce myself ceux-ci sont beaucoup de mots climatiseughhh. after reading comment  i relaize my french is better as i know french 

and you guys Biffel is important to GOOD Why aren’t the genders added? Most useful words:❎
Most useless words:☑️ I'm making notes (WITH PRONOUNCIATION..... AND IT IS TAKING FOREVER!) Fuck 😂😂 I don’t need to learn air conditioning where they come from this word is not good for being learned im in bread but in french Bread pain 13:00 I don't speak french, but sah quel plaisir My problem is I go through all these words, repeat them well, but then instantly forget them. Except for the few dozen I recall from the 2 years of high school French I took almost 30 years ago.

They say the mind is a sponge. Mine became saturated around the age of 20 and hasn't absorbed a thing since! Were good teaching I can teach you how to skip adds 😏 It's not free😅 My adopted sister is called Belle kindly share email id Rename this lesson "200 random words that are everything but essential" ffs how about some verbs, who gives a fuck about bycyles and shitty colours 😂😂 Merci beacoup boacoup for this show Wow I can’t Believe that the French language thinks beds are lit You gotta know "carabistouille" Put Lya in the image when she didn't even appear, that's clickbait. i am french and this is terrible exceptionnel !!! Wow 200 words Wow 200 words Pain, pronounced 'pont ' ( same as bridge ) ? Ah portable telephone One of the 200 essential words you need to know is ‘44’. Not, ironically, ‘200’. Great vid! I’m learning without a tutor! What level do you guys think I’m at?? Check out my recent video😁 I am from  India 🇮🇳 i am learning French language  this helps me a lot Is there a video u recommend for places to visit in France ? Or do you have a channel for that ???
Merci beaucoup Im just 11 year old, and im trying to know how to speak French,Japanese, and other languages ;-;

Is that weird, or okay? Just by knowing e-mail, feels like I’m 99.9% there... This channel is really nice 😍😍😍😍😍 Hi, I’m just came for watching your nice video but I wasted time by creating account for free French sheets from a link that you mentioned , you should keep honest in your work , you lied that it is free ,I’m proud of those people they don’t  lie that their service is free. You can say that we have wonderful and effective method to learn French only cost _________. 18:00 Spicy is épicé, NOT chaud Non ... j'ai vécu en Macédoine, j'ai appris le français, et j'ai déménagé en France, je connais tout le français et ce n'est pas vrai ... tu ne peux pas y croire..c'est peut-être le Canada français, je ne sais pas .. Where are the articles? It does give weight to the argument  of just saying everything with a French accent, "le passport" "le telephone" "le email" inglês: passport
francês: passa porra It would be nice to learn all these words with articles. would be better if the gender is included French. English very difficult And English I know very well I learn french   fighting 性が分からないと使えない **French person speaking fluent French**
me: climatiseur its hard to speak angel i'm surprised no one mentioned bread=pain
lol Guys make a  messager groupe to chat in english We need gender with noun fak off I only know chat noir,cause I watch miraculous ladybug and cat noir Video: livre
Sub : leave Why am I here i already no how to speak French bonjour les gens So George Bush
Is actually George Mouth? I'm in bread🌝✨ 2:31 This is the worst video.  What credible French instructor teaches nouns without including the article to specify gender?  Knowing the word is useless without knowing if it is masculine or feminine. LA KOUIZINEi feel like for beginners it may be too fast. Some very random sentences great...thank you for the time it toke to make this i wish my employer know this Genial, inglés y francés a la vez! 🤣✨ 👍 it is really cool that she/ he speak normal the phrases and it doesnt sound like he/ she is talking slowly.
P.d there a lot of phrases that i can understand beacuse i speak spanish as well. I am excited This is maybe for slightly after beginners... is this Canadian French? If learning French, you should put this language at last (by repeating it from slow speed to normal) to keep it lasting in our memory forever. One of the best. Keep on. Thanks Very useful and clear lesson. Thank you. 8:40- 30 This is super good I like type of vedio lessons Thanks a lot for sharing!!

Can you make it without English audio please? I'm doing a French app its hard but I'm improving Merci beaucoup Is this a real person speaking (the French)? It sounds somewhat simulated to me? this is actually very helpful thank you Such a beautiful language. "J'ai la diarrhee"😍👌 좋아요 For beginners giving a loose translation rather than word for word gets in the way of learning the written language. Anyone else slow it down? It helped a lot. Its really fast and for a beginner u shud have made it a bit slower (just my opinion) Thanks now I can play minecraft with my friend and actually understand what he's saying hopefully Merci beacoup for this nightmare of french 🥖🍟🥖🍟🥖🍟 The speed can be adjusted too. Good for beginners until your ear gets attuned. I agree...finally something useful. Oh! This is FANTASTIC!! Just what I need! Thank you!!!!! Perfect! I have been learning a little bit at a time for twenty years. This is like after studying Spanish from books for ten years and my communication was poor,  then I went to Mexico for two months and I returned to the States speaking with total comprehension!  Awesome! the english speaker is a real karen Omelette du Fromage? really love it its makes you challenge yourself every single sentence...! Thanks can you make it a bit more fast? like bahagsjsbajehzksjbebjdndjnd....it would be much easier for beginners. Im glad i found this thanks ,,,thanks for sharing new subscriber here merci means thank 0:49 9:05 Am I the only one who is listening because I love the way french people speak and I'm basically asleep? 

Am I?
;-; but it's like asmr- Bonne Annee!HAPPY NEW YEAR this is one of the best listening exercises. merci beaucoup! One of the best I've listened to so far!  Thank you! j'ai presque fini ！ Ever u use any break pastel? I don't know how do I start my french 🥖 croissant Thank you for this useful French Language Tool... Thank you, great exercise for my students I love this video a lot! This will help improve my knowledge of French Nice one. Who wants to practice? Click the wheel in video -> Playback Speed -> 0.75 5:43 ×0.75 is just perfect speed for me. Oui It's far to fast . . . Slow the speech down a little & might pick it up!

Merci beaucoup.... Merci beaucoup pour cette bon video  , meilleurs voeux pour Madame  , vous enseigne très bien  . Merci bcp this isn't slow..Je ne sais pas parler français mais en utilisant la traduction que j'écris ici. 😂 si vous pouviez le lire un peu plus lentement, ce serait plus facile à comprendre, merci beaucoup I was finally able to listen to the entire story! I am making very small improvements, but I will get there! i’m A1 in french but i can now understand 90% of it! i hope i won’t quit because this language it’s beautiful! i’m brazilian so i guess it’s easier for me to comprehend it 

i want so bad knows speak with fluency ❤️ I wish it had the English translation somewhere but I guess that’d make it too easy :) Merci! This is the good word that I remember because I'm a beginner so I don't know how to comment in French so Merci is good to express my feeling about this story Merci beaucoup Hi Make a video on petits Pas book2 please 🙏🙏🙏 love it thank you Nice video 👌 which software you use to edit video ? vdjpkj@gmail.com
Thanks 🤗 https://youtu.be/MUopWpXLm0U This is intermediate so why not listen to Michel Thomas and speak French with a Polish accent! Idk why but in my head it sounds like german (probably just me) You reading so fast make it slow reading 🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🌒🌓🌔🌍🌎⚡️🌪✡️⚛️☣️☦️🔯 Immense gratitude pour cette vidéo 😊 👍👍 this sukes I have to listen to her at 0.5 second speed because she's so fast. this too fast for beginners I need a story for school and omg am I saved I first listened to this at the end of my Basic 1 class and understood probably 10%. I tried again today (4 days after finishing Basic 2), manage to read it aloud (mostly correct compared to the audio) and understood 90% of the story. And to think that I thought I hardly learned anything in B1 & B2 (2 months of intensive). Très heureuse!! What is the app name please How is this for ”beginners”?! I swear speaking french is harder then speaking japanese Why can't they just upload the other audios on Youtube. Such a pain to go Audible I've been learning languages since I was a kid....The thing that is frustratingly difficult about French is that the pronunciation is not true to the spelling because they leave out so many consonants. It's the thing that makes understanding spoken French so much harder but at the same time, it is what makes French sound so sophisticated and pleasant to the ear compared to all the other Romance languages combined!....:\ Une très belle histoire I love when someone speaks in French,I just get something inside and outside that I want too speak like that ☺️😁 and btw your voice is angelic 🤗👌❤️ very good story! I'm really a beginner. I don't know anything but i want to learn. How i need to start? Btw i'm not native in english but i try to learn french by english sources. I don't understand some english words so this is a little hard for me :( merci Obrigado pelo trabalho. Li hoje. More -pleaseeeee Thanks for story.But I would love to see English subtitles of the story that will help us to understand what you are saying.Thanks in advance.😍😍😚😚😚 I definitely think that was a more intermediate level story for français learners, but great pronunciation, good job! Спасибо большой для эти видеоклипы с диалоги на французском :-) Is there an English  translation? Me: clicks the video for fun
*Sees the book*
OH I HAVE THIS! I still get lost while slowing this sh*t down to 0.5! LMAOL Thanks so much!
Can anybody help me, how can I making French reading my organization’s name for ‘oi’ not as ‘oa’. Like ‘toilet’ not as ‘toalet’? Do I need ‘oii’ , or ‘oÿ’, I don’t know exactly. Thanks merci beaucoup pour la video! I missed frensh language i studied it when i was in college in one year.... Now i forgot every things. 🎄🎄 Too fast not for beginners french j'ai niveau A2 de français et c'est très utile pour remplir l'espace manque quand on lit le français sans le pronunciation, sinon pour cette vidéo j'allais peut-être prononcer les mots incorrectement :P mercii Why is this described as a story for beginners.  It’s far from it and is being read too quickly https://youtu.be/yxQpR3TDCvE
French learning in easy & interesting way. Watch if you want to learn Thanks 😊 I know 4 languages fluently. This is the only _finish it in one breath language_ i find This is not a complain, I like the audio very much. But I'll be much more grateful if the English translation is put on. I loved the story but her voice was very irritating to me :( Ha ha ha is that for beginners ???? Belle histoire
En plus,elle est riche en vocabulaire exatamente dois anos depois! je ne pense pas que ces histoires courtes soient pour les débutants. Ce sont plutôt pour le nouveau intermédiaire. Du coup, c'est la présentation très utile et intéressante pour moi. Merci beaucoup. If you need good music to help you study and concentrate to improve your French, this channel is really very good, it helped me a lot, Perfect Harmony Music 😉🤗🙂🎵 https://youtu.be/M5BBp8_F6eI watch this

Bonsoir ❗Je suis japonaise. 
J'habite à Kobe avec mon mari. 

J'ai deux filles, mais elles habite Adults can learn by immersion plenty of people have moved to a country without know the language and picked it up there. This is exactly the kind of French tuition I have been looking for since ages. I had learnt French in my school and college days. I can read and understand written French and can also write it but when it comes to the French accent, I am stumped. This video lesson is a god-sent opportunity for me to acquaint myself with the exact French pronunciations.A big thumbs up! love french because mathmatical & scientifical language. Magnifique ！j’adore les histoires. Merci beaucoup 😊 Learn French one to one (Fluent English Speaker) by Skype, pass on / share, for details cfnehme@gmail.com I hate youssef le chien Felix trop mignon They need to slow down the narration if they're trying to target beginning learners. 7:10 do French People really swallow the nous in a sentence like that? There are  several things for how to learn French
Decide precisely why you wish to learn French
Try to use French everyday
Decide what process works for you best.
(I learned about these and more from Magic language method website ) I studied French for a few years,it is on my tv a few hours a day,I can read and write perfectly, but speaking is a other story. I Very good to listen this audio book.

3) Read the text and pause after each line, repeating after the speaker.

For French Video Lecture courses - www.LearnFrenchBySuchita.com Kotti Can I be fluent in French Language with your channel's video? Or is it just basics? I have been learning French from duliongo app but now I watched a your video To kese ho aap Mam iam beginer You have put virtual background.

Thanks I learned all letters Can elephant 🐘 be written as elephon in French like avion and dindon..?🙄as  it's pronounciation is similar to these words.. Highly useful video!! I checked many videos to learn the same, but this is the one that helps me a lot as the pronunciation is shown in Hindi. I just finished the first page (a-i). Just a suggestion.. I learnt the pronunciation of French 'R' from some other video before watching this video. Would it be better if the Hindi 'ra' in the video is replaced by 'kha' as in 'khargosh' or 'ha' as in 'havaa', so that it is more accurate than Hindi 'ra' as in 'ravi'? Ok I know that R is hard to pronounce & funny also 😂😂😂🤣 Thank you so much mam but can I ask you something actually I have some doubts can u plz clear it..!! A big thanku mam🙏 Excellent Eloddiz very good It's so fking tough 🥲 U should do this slowly..bcoz u r helping others to learn... otherwise video is good Superb teaching

Merci infiniment ! It was very good conversation I learnt what something. It's good for begginer 🌹🌹👍👍 😂🤦🏻 I can understand almost everything but I can't speak or write french c'est très simple et facile Thank you! Found my "French in Action" videos to watch again, and now these, which I didn't see originally, are a great addition. Really appreciate the uploads! man french shop keepers are kinda douchy. J'ai crois que il ne y a pas voulant de banque dan la france these lessons are the best, haha What a hag 16:10 May I know the actors' names, please? I really like this. More videos, please and thank you. Like it👍 Is it only me finding it useful more than nowadays methods of teaching languages?! merci Thank you, I have just started the course, it's verry helpful! I cracked I love these!  Merci beaucoup ! thank you so much my teacher for this  course ! you make me able to speak french vry easily I came across these videos last summer and made my son watch them before he started taking French in high school. I can honestly say that he learned a lot from this video course. Thank you so very much for sharing! As a teacher of foreign languages myself, I really admire how these lessons are made; without much efforts one picks up vocabulary, reading tips, correct pronunciation, and a bit of grammar. Brilliant! I actually liked this course so much that I bought the book to go with it. From the book, I learned that there was also a cartoon and a soap opera to go along the book as well as a radio course (tapes). I wish I could get all of them. By the way, the actress who plays Madame Dupont in the very first skit played two French-speaking characters in the famous British TV show "Upstairs Downstairs". Je amour cette video. C'est tres bon. Marci Beacoup. 7:19 Blood!
YouTube hasn't taken this down? Je trouve cette video tres utile!  Merci beaucoup pour la partager! What does the girl say at 7:36?? I hope, i will be able to speak French very good, thank you so much 👏 Thanks The film quality is so poor that it appears to open with with the Italian flag. anyone knows the actors name ?? https://youtu.be/lwYfT9tZsrg Merci beaucoup The girl  in 8:48 is the same girl  who  presents a french course for the BBC called " A vous la France"  a old one, from the eights French in Action was another good series awwww well  thank you so very very much for wanting to share this with us  we really do appreciate it big tyme.  :) i lyke this  french course too i been watching this 1  not long but  i lyke it  yeah merci   :) Such a great production no doubt made before not long after we were taken into the brainwashing machine known as the EU. The characterization of frog people is well observed here and it depicts a French context that is believable and if not overtly attractive is still very charming. Our current troupe of remain zelouts  would never permit or allow such an honest and free depiction of a foreign nations to be broadcast on the BBC of today.    Also the language teaching is well judged and not patronizing since there are many similarities between French and English. Its just that the middle class and upper class of Britain would have us believe that French is only for educated Britons. 
Don't just take my word with contrast this tour de force with the language teaching s;;;'t the BBC were pumping out in the mid 90s which was just a wet dream to appease the desires of bored accountants. 
oui j'ai eu une longue branlette de penser aux femmes qui ont joué l'infirmière stroppy :)
FUCK THE LIBERIAL DEMOCRATS AND ALL THE FACIST PIECES OF SHIT FORCING THE NATION TO A SECOND COSTLY REFRENDUM !!! Merci beaucoup At the skit at 9:25 is the actor who is the theif André Maranne?!? He was in the pink panther Am learning a lot from this...wow! Impressive! Great series Very helpful for me thanks a lots for your support and sharing this beautiful lesson. Merci beaucoup 😘 😘 😘 😘. these lessons are much more better than the lessons we buy with money. These tapes are a tremendous instructional for french beginners as myself.I must thank you sir immensely for sharing, This is yet the best Methode de francais I ever came across and still use today for practising French Brilliant! Why does he say "fierement garçon" ?  Not familiar with this expression BBC stopped making any more TV language programs, pity This is actually pretty funny I am Eritrea and I like this program Parfait 👌👌👌 C'est très bien pour moi ce video I love the intro; a Europe now going. found this from the book my grandma gave me, ensemble 1 french for beginners Carolle Rousseau, voulez vous etre ma femme? Thank you very much for uploading these!! C'est parfait! J'adore le video. Merci beaucoup! ❤ The way the actors portray personality types you'd come across in France is spot on , also the fact that it does not patronise the learner and is realistically  enacted  is great too. This is excellent much better then the modern travel loge type programs that have passed for language courses in recent years which are just aimed at middle class consumers. please make more videos.. Merci beaucoup pour cette video qui Legend qui I like it Bonjour, Ensemble French!
Super!
Merci et à bientôt. 
Brasil 2018. This was the best French course I have ever taken. I came across my books and wondered if the tapes were still available. I am grateful to the person who put these on YouTube. Thank you. c'est très bien Only a few of the videos uploaded in their channel. Need more. J'ai étudié le français il y a trois ans, j'ai adoré cette vidéo, très bonne, pour les étudiants de langue française. Merci d'avoir posté cette vidéo. Je suis brésilien. Fun to learn language nice Merci! Hahahah! I laugh so hard at the song called "Je ne sais pas" that was funny I feel bad I dont know these actors. They're  before my time XD This is really awesome. I am enjoying this video a lot. Thank you, obrigado, merci beaucoup! Merci beaucoup Merci beaucoup. What's the music playing at 10:30? amour je suis  dolly massion these old videos are the best for the beginners haha Probably the best ever French language course on BBC... ever. What's happened over the past 30 years... The BBC used to produce brilliant German, Spanish and Italian courses too... They were always supported by equally superb radio broadcasts too. The next stages I think were Sur le vif and Allez France. Also Franc Parler, France Extra and A vous  la France. Learnt so much French from these superb courses. Beaucoup merci j adore la programe Merci 8:14 Naughty nurse. Mon dieu! Elle est très belle! Comment s'appelle-t-elle? And that is one hell of a bank robbery, that is :-) Bonne continuation....Bravo Bonne continuation....Bravo One of the actors I think was in the "Gourmet Night" episode of Fawlty Towers! He's playing the long-haired customer at minute 16. Merci am looking for women of practice French +255767901170 This is the first time I see someone getting robbed like that. Bon bon ça va lolololol I love it! its fun to watch and easy to understand! Thank you. very entertaining C'est genial! love vintage stuff, ty for the upload, but who is the young man, i knew Bridget and Maurice j'adore le programme quite helpful for A1 and A2 level  --

In or im is pronounced more like ऐं as in मैं. The letter for J and "soft" G sound (IPA: /ʒ/) does exist in Hindi. It is झ़. Courage would be कूग़ाझ़. https://youtu.be/AWhdKChtCoE thanks Thank u sir This is very boring process of tiaching Please speak louder Excellent lesson.

Please suggest me sir great sirrrrrrrr..... hello g m Mai kitne din me Friench language seekh sakta hu Hi,
Im not demotivating you. From my personal experience,If anybody wants to learn foreign language except English, Please learn in English. For Example, If you need to speak German or french, Study in English, because most of the grammatical structures are much differ from English.So you can easily identify difference and learn it quickly. Thus you may  get good fluency in English too. Sir, your videos are extremely helpful. Though my English is good, I get to learn a lot from your videos because your French pronunciation is so perfect and easy to understand as you keep writing in Hindi. Thank you! Dhanywaad sir mujhe waha kbhi nhi jana par mujhe French sikhne me bhut dilchaspi hai🙏 Very good sir +97335424182 Sir kitne shreef hain sir please prounce and write R letter *Bonjour* Ur voice is not clear I heard kha or ka??

आप का फ्रेंच भाषा सीखाने का तरीका बहुत ही अच्छा है बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद, पर एक रिक्वेस्ट है आपकों आप जो अक्षर या जो भी लिखते हैं उसे थोड़े बड़े अक्षर मे लिखते तो हमे बराबर पढने में और लिखने में सुविधा रहेगी, और एक बात नई भाषा होने की वजह से उसके उच्चारण में थोड़ी दुविधा रहतीं हैं तो साथ साथ आप जो लिखते हैं उसके प्रन्नश्येशन हिंदी में लिखते तो हम बराबर तरीके से उसको समझ सकते, 
बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद There are 26 letter in English not 29... so be carefull english में 26 अक्षर होते है 29 नही ... Respected Sir, which foreign language will get scope in India,After 5 years. Great Sir,  Please suggest any Hindi Or English book name for leaning French . Thank u sir Where is lesson 3 Sir. U are really great 😇😇😇😇 E ko Kya bolye hai Sir aur bhi video daalo Love to speak.... In our village almost everyone know english, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, Portuguese...... Nice, sir I gotten well Sir 26 alphabet ka French me pronunciation alag alag likh de please! hi Thank you sir for teaching in Hindi... Thanks Sir Please SPANISHI will learn 8 languages If you speak with a Belgian you can say septante for 70 et nonante for 90, its easier 71= septante et un; 72= septante deux, 91=nonante et un, 92= nonante deux :)! Bonne chance, passez en Belgique une fois ! Learn 8-10 languages and you will have a common language with most people in the world :D i just found this very useful and easy thank you  seriously!!!! ! The French number system is so retarded -.- It's impossible to learn speaking like she's doing it :C For people like me who has to repeat this 1000x times before they understand 0-10
0:27  soo anooying that there is no numbers just for 70 , 80 and ninety they have to be very confusing dont they :) Tanks this is very handy  you talk very clear! nice  ;((WHY CAN'T WE ALL HAVE THE SAME LAGUAGE!!!!! @musliminuk1 According to French grammar, the final /t/ in vingt is pronounced for numbers 21-29 inclusive. (French Grammar and Usage, Hawkins and Towell, p.137.) she looks like my teacher, @StudyFrench are you called miss valles? very good teacher!
I'am from greece and i wish i have teacher like you to study my french
thank you for suport
 thank  u Rita u hve helped me nderstand it more thn my teacher
 brilliant help with french homework @Stevanop no this video has revealed to me what to me what six years of schooling could not!!
 Its more easy when you go to a french immersion school. :) @learnfrenchvideos yea, y cant they just say '60' instead of 'watever bla bla bla' uggh @foxgirl100 AHH we have a french test tomorow and we ave to be able to count to 100 in french, GOD DAMN IT'S SOOOO HARD, I can get to 50, then I hate the french laguage from then on. >:( cheers that was helpfull Why do french numbers from 60-100 have to be so complicated?  ...the french numbers are like danish numbers....not that they are the same....but french and danish numbers got  peculiar logic.... Soooo difficult ohhh my godddd now i see when ppl want to learn english and i find it sooo easy if they are having a time like this its bad cause even my head hurts cause of how hard im thinking lol and teacher your are really good looking by the way(though it doesn't help me concentrate : /) French people from france say 60-10, 4-20, 4-20-10 for 70,80 and 90.
But french from Swisserland and Belgian have one word for 70,80,90 wich is easier to learn. They say "septante" (70) "Huitante" (80) and "Nonante" (90) don't pronounce the "e" @musliminuk1 You pronounce the "t" only if you have a word after, to make a liasion.However, you can pronounce the "t" with the word "vingt" alone, some people do that, like people from quebec, Swisszerland or Belgian. @kutie808bebe i know its so annoying. why cant they just have a word for 70, 80 & 90? instead u gotta say 60 & 10, 4 twenty, and so on... confuuuuuuusing! Con esa profesora voy a aprender rápido! (....mamacita!!!!!) ele dit "th" a onze douze treize @RockPop1337 AT* I know this might be inappropriate but goddamit she's cute. :) Thanks for the memory. I studied French for 4 months and I found it hard to learn. It's hear and there for me. But then again, I speak Spansih, some Italian, English, and French excellent! studied French for seven years so I'm fine with the numbers but this video is great for working on pronunciation.It was so helpful thnx♡♡♥♥♥♥♥ Nicely taught my dear not teached😗 I like u well? Heureux? Seriously? They couldn't find a simpler weird? I mean word 😂 I'm sorry but it sounds like a computerized voice butchering somebody's name! Heureux, the pronunciation is out of this world! I luv it when people use this in conversations with a straight face! I just can't pronounce it! Editing this comment (think of the word 'error' heureux sounds like badly pronounced 'error') btw this isn't me poking fun at it, in the beginning yes I was poking fun at it. I can't pronounce heureux :( Merci Love these lessons! Really makes learning French so much easier! Thanks so much ❤️ Even if learning french is difficult with détermination u van do it Merci beaucoup;) A bientot! Merci beaucoup 👌🏿 Merci beaucoup It's very useful !! For a beginner without any fundation, it's suitable. merci Thanks a lot for teaching me French :-) I think for a foreigner the word endings aren't that big a deal; there are only a few of them that result in a different sound, and beginners would likely be give a pass. They differences between the orthography and pronunciation of a word only become apparent, of course, in the written form, and seem to be as irregular as hell. Exellent! Exellent! thank u so much coz it helped a lot but pronunciation still aproblem Merci, la tante Lol my prononciation is great but I can’t freakin read Really nicely teached with pronunciation. I appreciate I think the lesson jumps too quickly on from lesson one.  There needs to be a balance between learning verb structure and pronouns and some new vocabulary. merci je t'aime bien lesson lol Great job keep those videos coming! Je t'aime plus! Good  working 
good. merci , je t'aime *the lesson* beaucoup Nice lesson Je suis tres content....  perfect lesson..👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 merci,a bientot Merci, je t'aime bien! 😊 IDl t  ST Merci beaucoup!!! merci Really good lessons,  merci! This is bloody difficult but it's entertaining .   I appreciate your efforts could please send me more items coz am desperate to learn French. I'm going to make vocabulary/flash cards. It's very clear, but my tongue can't help The grammar and the pronunciation are frustating! Actually, I think "beaucoup" means "alot" 1:20 Looks like Paul Young lol I can read some things in French, but the pronouncing really just sets me off, why are the words pronounced so different from what they look like ,  oh its not easy but i'll give a try >__< can you make the alphabets sound fist  so I can sounded better ?
I want to learn Italian so badly
and other language and I will love to teaching you Indonesian or Balinese :)  Mister Tanks a Lot God blees you  Also, I saw someone a while back asked about "it is". In case anyone else ends up wondering, it is "il est" (same as "he is"). @ninjaturtles12121 @smellycatrulesxX It is because the e at the end of "elle" is not pronounced. The confusion is due to the rule not being properly explained: It's not that every word ending in a vowel needs a ' for the liaison, it's that any word ending in a vowel SOUND needs ' for a liaison. So it is "elle est" not "ell'est". that's awesome.tx "on" is more familiar than "nous", so you can use 'on' when you speak to your friend for example. bon travail I think it's because "Elle est" they both end in the same vowel "e" so they don't consider it to be a clash of the vowels. I don't know if that's right, though.  In "Elle est contente" shouldn't that be Ell' est contente? b/ of the two clashing vowels based on ur prev lesson? I am confused can some1 explain this please. best lessons ever!!!! Merci, this is one of the best videos for French beginners. namaste ..... 
SHUBA-PRABHAT (NEPALI) - GOOD MORNING (ENGLISH) - BONJOUR (FRENCH)  merci beaucoup* :) MERCI BEAUCOUP Well, "on" is impersonnal, like "il" can be sometimes. But there is a strong tendancy to use "on" the same way you would say "we", but it's not traditionnal, it's not "proper" French, but I get we'll have to update our grammar rules soon... Of course, and I'd say the same thing for Spanish, since I speak French and I'm learning Spanish. El vocabulario que es percivido "antiguo" en francés es acutal en castellano y viceversa. Do you know that French (and perhaps everyone that speaks French) don't see Paris as the city of romance (only for the tourists) ? For us, it's Venice only. une gomme à effacer (international), une efface (Québec), assuming you're talking for an eraser you would use with a pencil. gomme
 These videos are extremely helpful! Merci beaucoup! je qustions how to say eraser
 gl learning french out of boredom Donne un bisous a ta main gauche

Jane looks like spanish but its not pronounce as spanish -.- merci beacoup Great Lesson! :) On is less formal than nous. So in daily life the france mostly say on, but in more formal occasions they say nous. the moment he pronounced the word "heureux", I know this is gonna be an extremely hard language to learn you are a fantastic teacher god bless you i have learned a lot from just this video i am going to learn all your videos. je t'aime bien, A bientot!!!!!   love zha zha merci beaucoup  merci beaucoup  merci beaucoup  Question: How to say "I love you very much"? I assume it's not "Je t'aime beaucoup".  this video helped me a lot in my french thanks whoever made it @jjrr64 pour cette lecons** :D @HorseRiderJenna C'est super :) @HorseRiderJenna c'est super, c'est génial ! your videos will help me speak to my sister well! @iamredapple1993 its he is into sports Merci beaucoup can anyone please tell me the difference between "on est" and "nous somme" they both mean we are ? merci beaucoup :) But how do you say  "I love you very much" ?

Fantastique!!!!! thank you alot you are cute and its funny how you are so serious at the same time, and besides that, you really teached me something! thanks for that ! @MoonfulBlue yeah, everyone says ''quatre heures moins quart'' but the REAL way to say it is the way she showed it. c'est bien pour la show thanks! :-) @DamianRavenblood You should see some pronounciations lecons and espacially pronounciations when you have more than one syllabe like "oi", "ou", "ei", "eu", "oe"... @MoonfulBlue No. It is "Quatre heures moins LE quart". ;-)
It is weird for French persons too but if you don't say "le" it is VERY weird :p my stupid french teacher gave me a 50 year old textbook which is in all french n its been like 2 weeks.. how the hell does she expect me to find the time chapter if i cant read man the "heures" part is hard to pronounce  this is so helpful Finally , Finally I understand.

Ive heard some decent things about it and my mate got cool success with it. Don’t search to understand why In French we have MANY variants words Bonjour Professor! Merci beaucoup pour ton cour. Je viens de encontre ton Channel y je crois et très utile. you made it so short and simple thank you. The name of this video should have been "how to ask yes or no questions". Nice work! Aujourd'hui, j'ai enfin comprend le french! Merci! Dick i dont like language lol but this helps a ton Excellent teaching...better than alexa... the best french tutor on youtube....keep it up. When your teacher asks you to watch this and complete the worksheet- but there is no worksheet- EST - CE QUE VOUS PARELES  ANGLAIS ? I doubt anyone will see or respond to this question, but on the off-chance someone does... is it always "est-ce que"? Could this ever be replaced by something else? Too good Estaba confundida gracias por las tres maneras explicadas 🤗 muy bien! Merci beaucoup This is our first fucked In the beginning of video I thought she would speak  'we're going to APPRENDRE LOL This is useful. However the ‘f’ in français should not be in capital letter. I wonder how she looks now Good job Techeare but why shart 12 hours before my exams Apprendre le français autrement

Bonne journée Good Is there any script for this? Un bon aide 35/35, but I really feel like I couldn't understand half of what was said! Had to watch at 0.5x I already got delf B1 but now after not using French at all for almost 3 years, i need to get back to test myself in A1, luckily i still got my touch, thank you so much for the video J'ai compri tout car je suis dans le niveau b1 Got 2 exercises with 100%!

I am so thrilled with the way you teach us French. It's absolutely unique easier and fascinating. 
Thank you so much for sharing this amazing way of teaching. 
You mean everything to me. 
Merci beaucoup 
You really make French easily. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRJm0zDCIw0 Very good I had all ? does the audio get played twice in the actual delf exam ? Yeah I’m lost. I don’t even understand the directions Lel Merci This was a great little challenge :). Giving only 20 seconds, speaking at a decently fast speed, made this fun and rewarding Bien Hi got 32 right... is that good.. or need to score full marks? These helped a lot and hopefully I don't flunk my listening comprehension test tomorrow. Bonjour Je vous aides en français et vous m’aidez en anglais ,  qui est pour ? Pretty easy! I got only one wrong! For those who are aiming to improve their French skills ,I recommend the book alter ego A1 plus. I've started to learn French 5 months ago with this book and I can say that my basic French is pretty good now! Are these exercises up to the level of DELF A1 test? Or is the A1 test harder than this? I got only 8 options wrong in the whole the exercise Transcription?? Merçi! I take my DELF exam today. It help me so much. Merci for sharing French is a beautiful language I did pretty good! I just need to practice my grammar and oral speaking. Taking the DELF test this year! Only one wrong This was very helpful! Merci!

Merci beaucoup. Merci beaucoup Merci beaucoup Monsieur et madam tres bon pour la preparation du Delf Cette vidéo est très utile!
Pourriez-vous me dire où se trouve la transcription? Je ne le trouve pas dans la description de la vidéo.
Muchas Gracias! the starting music is dope this video helped me a lot Merci! Merci beaucoup! Belle voix Merci beaucoup S'il vous plait telecharger le plus d' e'coute MerciBon Merci beaucoup Unne bonne vidéo merci beceop Merci merci beaucoup!! 😁 Very very helpful. Make more dialogues . Thank you! Мerci beaucoup!!! Beaucoup Merci beau coupon This conversation is too fast
For beginners .
Please do the conversation video beginners can understand. ca fait combien does mean literally it makes how much (How much is that). Simply sentence mapping isn't sufficient to learn the language. Word to word mapping is important and when you put a different sentence you pull that person back from learning by teaching wrong equivalences as he will try to use the words elsewhere. But I have to tell this is one of the best videos. Even french people videos don't seem to be as good as this.So my request is put (Literally : it makes how much, Verbally : How much is it). It will be the best. الله يبارك فيك وشكرن جزيلا 🙋 🙋 🙋 👍 👍 👍 👍 💖 💛 👌 👌 👌 👌 Merci Monsieur Merci beaucoup super vidéo .... vraiment adoré .... merci beaucoup Merci !!!!!!!

Merci beaucoup.votre chases.préfarée s'il vous plaît Très bienabsolutiontheory98, no offense but what you said was kinda mean, because Mandarin might be a beatuiful language. (I never studied Mandarin, so I don't know if it's a cool language or not, but I think it is). :) morenita0031, that's is mean. I'm learning French atm, thank you for getting me started allez-vous Merci pour cette vidéo.  Je viens de la partager avec un groupe d'étudiants américains avant qu'ils n'arrivent en France. je ne parle pas francais REALY comment tu t'appelles morenita0031 I love French!!!!!!!! Thnx a lot for this video.It is very helpful for the beginners.. The problem with french is that while you have a bulk of words, you are required to pronounce it as few words. this is a disgusting language... There's a little pronounciation mistake for "comment" in "comment vous appelez-vous", but it's good, I can hear you are not French, but it's very good. I am french and half of those words are wrong! Lol DUHHHH Mon ami is a word you forgot
 Well I hate Mandarin.But I think French looks more interesting to learn because its a beautiful language I agree i love french!!If you like my lessons, keep in mind that the YouTube videos are just the visible part of the iceberg... The full curriculum with videos to go from level A1 to level B2, Ibooks, Ebooks, Apps, printable PDFs, Online Quizzes, and much more... It is simply the best and the most complete place to learn French at your pace: https://www.french4me.net scazzarasa , gli sta per venire una paralisi facciale janice lhamu Doma the best of luck to you by phone lol الا🍮🍦🍵🚿🔴✨🔳⚪⬛⚫🔊🔑🔎↪🔓🔅🔆🔏🔒🔖🔄🔘 why don't you just record your mouth as you read numbers..? ㅠㅠ The boy looking like his is constipated, lol does everyone else think this video is freaky?   cause it is!!!!! he is freaky French and Portuguese are very similar!  lol😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄🎍🎍🎊🎆🎃🎃🎆🎊🎏🎇 Thanks. :)   Does help me. :)

Merci :) thats definatly not easy":) Started learning french about a week ago, helpya boi out, any tips? This is just slightly above my level so its very helpful! Thanks! i hate learning french smdh freakin canadian schools Can't understand 😘😭😭😭 Plz more tales I pretty much didn't understand a single thing from this 'Story for Begginers' One day soon, I’ll be able to understand all of this. Je l'adore! Me changing the speed of the video to 0.75... XD Please put the English beside the French I want to know if I'm reading it right For a beginners story, you tell it too fast!! I thought I was listening to an intermediate story and not a beginners telling!! It sucked!! Très douce! Merci! je ne comprends pas :[ Difficle ;-; Most teachers don't understand the process of language acquisition. Beginners need to understand, not every word, but need to feel that they can understand most of the time what's going on, what's the story is about.  If little children don't get the message, their parents will simply say it again in a simple manner. There's interaction so parents get feedback and clues about their children's level of comprehension. With that information they can try better to communicate and adjust the pace and the level of the language so their child gets to understand the meaning of the words and sentences. Parents naturally do what is necessary to facilitate comprehension. By reading comments here I have confirmation that this video is not well adjusted for beginners. Too difficult. If I understand everything and know all the words, what level does this make me? Yes I am still not able to understand this story , who is learning through Duolingo ????????????? Thank you! This is going to be excellent practice. I have a LONG way to go before I understand. Just the practice I need!!! but we need translation too Please slowly Ive been taking French for 11 years and I still don't understand any of this let's talk guys .I don't know french.But i will learn.Let's talk and help each other I think by beginner they don’t mean your first year in French because I’m in level 3 and this is the sort of stuff we’re learning easy to understand This isn't for beginners Her voice is fantastic and she speaks very fast and that's very good (my opinion) But first day of school is premier jour d’cole so is la rentrée des classes is just another way of saying it This is great! Thanks. Merci bien!!!😊 Boy, did I think I could understand French before this video! J'ai tout compris sauf quelques mots. https://largepdf.com/french-short-stories-for-beginners-20-captivating-short-stories-to-learn-french-grow-your-vocabulary-the-fun-way-easy-french-stories-t-1-french-edition/

How can a beginner keep up with it. at 5:09 they called Madmoiselle Loudun, "Madame" i think there is a problem 4:30 Why does it sound like she' saying (phonetically) "du jolon". Is there some kind of interaction between the "du" and "v"? Le français est la plus belle langue - merci! It is wonderful keep going I don't know enough as of yet to even get the gist of what's going on. Having said that however, I still know a lot more than I thought. Real confidence booster. Que verga? c'est bonne Mademoiselle Loudun s'est devenue Madame Loudun "Easy French Stories" still can't understand most of it by listening. Trés utile .

This really helped thanks!! i love it when you lick your lips at 1:50 in the video 😅🤤 en Français on dit 'DANS LA RUE" et non SUR LA RUE(C'est du Franglais) do you have boyfriend ? ::D Vous parlez vraiment bien français Nice Tu es adorable i appreciate you that giving a classes through youtube. I m not here to judge you. cause i m learning french. you are doing very good...but there are some mistakes.don't thing about there people cause you are helping those people who can' afford a fee for class. my french teacher teach me that pres de means near.
 first pres de means near (a cote de means next to). Je vous remercie A point noone realized; at one point she said "tournez à gauche" while she had to say"tournez à droite"! It's at 4:10 thank you madam Merci beaucoup thanx dear Rita I hate salon En face de...

just keep going please THANKS A LOT YOU ARE GREAT Merci beaucoup Rita. 
il a été très instructif, u r amazing thanks for ur efforts <3 4:06 lol Merci ! You're soo much better than my french teacher xD thx Muy buen video, gracias!! very effective....you get the point!!!...thx. Nice lecturer Bon professeur.   ;) i like it class but i want more class Is this what is called "French Canadian" (or vice versa)?
Some of these expressions are not what I am used to. I don't want to say that they are *wrong*, but just not what I was taught, and I have not heard any French people speaking like this. I am mostly familiar with a Parisian accent, and also the Corsican accent.
From which part of France (or francophonia) do you hail? what a wonderful channel! There are mistakes in this video.  For example, pres de does not mean 'next to'.  It means 'near'.  Next to, is 'a cote de' (no accents on my laptop, sorry!).  Also the spelling mistake of bibliotheque.   Also, en face de means 'opposite', not 'in front of'.  In front of, is 'devant' .  Too many mistakes. There are spelling mistakes.  Correct spelling for: Bibliothèque.  Métro. I enjoy these lessons . They are very informative. Here is a small point on the directions.To get to the bank from the school you would have to be walking backwards. So in fact when you face the correct way instead of turning left at rue de bloor you would turn right.  merci pour votre lesson! salutations brasilien! (est que ce correct?)
 wow french people are so arrogant about their language!! get over yourselve if you think that she is not good enough to teach french then you should be teaching, that would really help others to learn your language as it should be...take care :)  with all the due respect.., why are you surprised? she's doing the best... if you're an expert in french language why don't you teach by yourself and stop criticizing her? Its bibliotheque


 Hello learners , 

I am french native speaker and I am surprised to see someone teaching french ( who obviously is not french because of her accent ),  on the board behind her there are 2 spelling mistakes !! In french we write "bibliothèque" and "métro" like that . Some advice if you want to learn a foreign language , take a native speaker , a spanish for spanish language , an english for english language .... thanks for the video, thats my next lesson  Thank you for this video - I will definitely make it available to my students.  Please don't mind this comment, but you might want to note that bibliothèque (shown on the dry erase board in the first scene) is misspelled (it's missing the"h"). u tot helped me thx Merci beaucoup professeur. thanks for this vedios,they are really benifit to us
 You're so cool, man! 2:57 my favorite moment
 2:13
 hello mo mo
 Im listening to this in class woop im a rebel la poste on a tous a y gagner I think the "H" of bibliothèque as been volountary "forgotten" to avoid confusion with the "th" sound in english... And I often use the shortened "la poste" instead of "le bureau de poste".... normaly, is ' dans la rue' and no 'sur la rue' ?
 THANKS.... THIS IS A  USEFUL CLASS...
GREETINGS FROM ECUADOR.
 معلمة عظيمه 
تدريسك رائع جدا و مناسب لجميع المستويات 
اتمنى ان تكملي ما بدأتي There´s something really lovely about the teacher. She´s both charismatic and beautyfull. Also a good lesson. Qu'avez- Vous Dit ? Qu Est De Back ? I'm actually picking it up! Rita's good! she got swagger when teaching (snaps fingers) @donnecoeur I think 'droit' is only used in the context 'tout droit', which means 'straight'. The word 'droite' however, means 'right'.  
Tout droit = straight 
Droite = right. Thank you for a great lesson- I really enjoy your style - I can wait for more videos ..  regards 
Nissim Cohen New Zealand  You can teach me all French you want babe with that pretty smile. haha true ;) but its a little mistake :) The insruction for heading south from the school to the bank and turning left is confusing, does nort sound correct. Pres l'ecole, continuez tout droit sur la rue  Bloor et tournez a gouche. C'est ne tournez  pas droite.?  Using an example of headinfg north and turning left would be easier to undrerstand.Merci merci beaucoup ♡you can make your intro like Korea unni Superb way of teaching French loved it.

 Please I will like to learn everything in French Mucho bla bla bla en ines You're looking different from before Lya Lya you are so pretty,I love you so much. 😍😍the way she teaches 🌸👏 Je suis visage laid. 👌👌👌👌👌  एक्सीलेंट । I find her interesting..flat face no jokes learning time ..onto the point... I dont understand French and I never want to learn it. im glad because its an absolutely imperialistic country, and its shameful how they invaded and drove to extinction all the native culture and languages of the people whom they conquered, mostly assimilated in current France. French is not native to even 50% of the french territory, yet they ensure it is the countries language, while the actual original languages of current French land are treated as "non-existant" by France. Also, their speakers have no rights, only the right to shut up and become extinct. This is a cultural and linguistic genocide, still going on nowadays, and almost completed by "France". They just made sure by force, law, the media and the French state to eradicate their languages and cultures. Thats a true cultural and linguistic genocide, what the french carried out and still carry out nowadays. I laugh at the equality principle in France, sure were all equal as long as u speak French and abandon the original culture of ur own land and people, so u can become fully assimilated by France. I hope the day comes when France gets judged for the cultural and linguistic genocides it carried out within its borders. They almost drove to extinction occitan, alsacian, corsican, basque, catalan and breton in France, the original language spoken in the lands they now inhabit and whose people have by force and pressure abandoned their forefathers culture and language. Completely assimilated their people by the force of law and making they feel inferior for not as quoted "being clean & speaking french". Shame to France! Please show respect and learn the original languages of the land which u invaded and whose people u mistreated, to amend for ur crimes. Ill never learn such a disgraceful language as I think France is a disgraceful country. I really understand much better with your method; the systematic way in which it is designed for new Students of the French Language allowed me to learn it very easy.
Thanks for your great method👍 Who still says "mademoiselle" or "mon ami" in 2021 ? old people maybe Your French so good I am also learning french How often do you think bon gets misspelled as bom in French Google searches - for example, a ‘good’ tower :/ or a word from the 30% shared from French Lya, COMMENT VAS-TU. , Ca Fait Longtemps!.. where is your personality? this is not fun to learn anymore.. Thanks 👍 so much for the lesson it really understanding D: Some times I speak this in public. In spelling slowly in order to understand. Don't be fast. Ok? I hate you @guy who bosses around and changes people. Bonjour Everyone Glad i can say "visage laid" now. 👌👍 :( aww she’s so serious I doubt whether this was Lya Nd I’m just confusing her with another Lya. They have made her into a robot :( ohhh its hard for me but i wll tyry my best 6:06 HE IS A BAD BOY... OLD LYA SMILED A BIT... HEHE :P If last word of france language will pronounce in silence We want old lya back. Cocok sekali untuk pemula suaranya sedang tak kecepatan see you soon aurevoir I hate your chael Lya, what happened? We want od Lya back Frenchpod 101 is tres gros maintenant. Tres professionnel.  Tres serieux... but, I still love you Lya.  :) I hear some words ending with the sound ( sh ) but there is no letter for that , please comment on that , merci beaucoup C'est pas Lya! Merci beacoup 🥰🥰💜 I can't, it's difficult Merci beaucoup lya💝 Merci beaucoup😀 Your teaching is very clear than other teachers I can't imagine how many followers this channel lost since they are forcing Lya to lose her spirit and soul. Wishing you the best Lya! Agree with a lot of the other comments. I liked these videos because her personality is  fun and engaging. Don't force her to be so serious. Good job I'm learning at quarantine status,, Wh y the change? She sounds like a robot. A boring one Who's behind the camera with that gun. ಥ‿ಥ Thanks alot The FrenchPod 101's management team has a problem, they cannot tolerate one teacher is much popular than others,  they forced (or were forced to make) their best teacher to be average. The consequence is that FrenchPod 101 became just like other thousands French lessons on the internet, nothing special.   I feel bad for Lya, I also feel bad for other teachers.   Your guys should find a smart solution, e.g. Lya may host other types of lessons, such as story reading, news talk, let all teachers to exercise their different talent. Good luck! Where is Lya:( These videoes are really helpfull   and     OUI I am now better in french pourquoi? pourquoi?pourpoui? why so serious Lya? I feel motivated to learn french because of your awesome and funny teachings...it was so much fun and entertaining..but this lesson sounded so boring..come back to the normal mode Lya..we really want you to be yourself.. actualy lya is a robot omg sweet great Bring my lya back!!!! The real lya Lya ur name in my language means mine 😉 so be mine🌈


NVM au revoir is so cool to say i liked it when you said  "thank you" I agree with all these people! We want the old Lya back not just a robot like individual!!!  Please let the caring, funny entertaining Lya come back or I’m gone So, robotic We still love you Lya. But we miss old Lya. Always enjoy your videos.  Merci Mon Amie this is my first time seeing Lya but apparently this isn't normal? lol you guys should reach a mid term on her behavioiur , she's really nice! why lya like's a robot?,not like her before Bonjour Bon How she is teaching/ explanation is clear and slow,,,me beginning learn,,easier to catch it,, Moi getting out mon notes, which has like ALMOST 1000 words et how to say it lol 😂 (Je suis going to Paris Disney world Une day) Thnx Lya. I like learn French. Mam can you tell me the French conversation of Same to you? Time to learn how to make it sound french dhfnjdjsjcjs Nice video I miss Lya’s mischief 😞 You are looking nice though lol ;p Lya your personality is awesome!!! Wanna see it again! This is not the Lya I know. She used to be so cute and funny. This is not her! Bring Lya back! Merci Smelly Près de = next to Hopefully this would work... DONT FORGET MUNDO, HE YOUR FRIEND LYA NO LEAVE MUNDO ALONE!!! WELL DONE,,, LYA Je m' appelle Claude Loved the older Lya videos. This is nothing. U r cute Seriously it is killing me Lia cutiepie I can't control my laugh babie looking like you teaching like this greetings Very nice video 👍✍️✍️😉 Lmao 😂 Marci Lya to tell all this thing YOU LYA NOT JON I think it is very helpful for beginners. I'm pretty sure that they forced lya to explain things slowly and in a serious way so much so she is doing this to break the system by following their order to the extreme Here’s a phrase.






Billy Joel est très mignon! I love this video I’m brésilien , I live in Paris Lya, what happened to you? I admit that the way you speak french now is very helpful. However,  you can still be your old-self when you speak slowly. Anyway, I still enjoy learning french with you, keep it up. it's... it's very scares me.... Lya. mon amour ;) Lya did they brainwash you? Common Lya snap out of it. my tongue can't even do this hElp
