Does it mean the French Language has two versions of every single word? really easy to understand, I learn a lot. :) I like the way you teach, you go through every words and explained it very well on the proper pronunciation, the grammar, etc. not just a flat reading from a translated english sentence where in it is hard to catch up. a little background in spanish also helps. merci and more power! Is this video sufficient to learn French

*coughs to death*





*never doing that again im quitting school* I am Russian watching in English how to learn French ‡≤†_‡≤† Worst teacher ever you can't teach beginners who are trying to learn and speak that fast you can't catch the pronunciation or nothing it's sound like a sound of diarrhoea wow...its confusing because you pronounce the words differently from its spelling...i guess french alphabet is different...\ My throat hurts üò≠ You look like Caroline from tvd I‚Äôm currently learning French before I go to Paris for Juste Debout and it‚Äôs this girl down there I like and so yeah lol 12 years of school taking French classes for nothing :( J‚Äôai appris le fran√ßais! It helps that the teacher is hot. This is really easy 
Enchant√©e de te recontrer 16:16 I dont understand French and I never want to learn it. im glad because its an absolutely imperialistic country, and its shameful how they invaded and drove to extinction all the native culture and languages of the people whom they conquered, mostly assimilated in current France. French is not native to even 50% of the french territory, yet they ensure it is the countries language, while the actual original languages of current French land are treated as "non-existant" by France. Also, their speakers have no rights, only the right to shut up and become extinct. This is a cultural and linguistic genocide, still going on nowadays, and almost completed by "France". They just made sure by force, law, the media and the French state to eradicate their languages and cultures. Thats a true cultural and linguistic genocide, what the french carried out. I laugh at the equality principle in France, sure were all equal as long as u speak French and abandon the original culture of ur own land and people, so u can become fully assimilated by France. I hope the day comes when Ftance gets judged for the cultural and linguistic genocides it carried out within its borders. They almost drove to extinction occitan, alsacian, corsican, basque, catalan and breton in France, the original language spoken in the lands they now inhabit and whose people have by force and pressure abandoned their forefathers culture and language. Completely assimilated their people by the force of law and making they feel inferior for not as quoted "being clean & speaking french". Shame to France! Please show respect and learn the original languages of the land which u invaded and whose people u mistreated, to amend for ur crimes. Ill never learn such a disgraceful language as I think France is a disgraceful country. timestamps
