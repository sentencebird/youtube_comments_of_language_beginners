I mean, is that all the grammar I need to know?? 1:17:18 using a time stamp for myself lol Whats the difference between 1s-3s and 1p-3p 7 minutes in was so very helpful! I simply could not figure out the pattern using Rosetta Stone as they don't explain anything. It's a great learning tool except for the grammar part is lacking in my opinion. I simply con't just figure it out with pictures alone. Now I understand. Thanks so much! Vincent, I can't thank you enough for your work here.
It has been more than a week since I started to learn french again since high school and you did an amazing job at explaining basic grammar for a beginner. I took notes of everything you mentioned here and now I am moving to your next video "Learn French in 5 days".

Rubbish, Not complete, only stuck with present tense Why after  1:28 you started putting already used content? https://youtu.be/mm5CCw7NeuY Thanks good Merci Vincent.

27:37 nice lecture It‚Äôs really a good video that each part not so long. But sometimes I don‚Äôt know what the sentence means, I think it would be better to make a English translate near the French sentence. Hope you a beautiful day. üíõ Waaait a moment! What an earth is going on at 51:54? When the video ends, a picture of an old desktop shows up briefly, and to my astonishment the button in the bottom left corner is in Finnish.

Decide exactly why you wish to learn it
Try to speak French everyday

I am not Italian but I love this anime which one of the parts is set in Italy, and I thought it be cool learning Italian. Come si chiama? Formal

Come ti chiami? Informal Learn Italian Words (2018) I‚Äôm learning this because of a YouTuber called Davie504 and he is Italian Please more video Grazie di tutto üôèüèº I've known French and Spanish for years. Stared learning Italian about a week ago. My previous studying of French and Spanish is very helpful as the words are so similar. I looked at some basic words. Italian colours resemble the French words while Italian body part names resemble the Spanish. If I picked an unrelated language to learn like Russian, Chinese, Indian or Hebrew then I'd be studying way harder. There'd be no clues whatsoever. Diciamo che un ragazzo ti parlo e dire che lui √® solo ma lo piacci.

Don't mind me just practicing my Italian I so wanna go to Italy. I wanted to learn it for fun and I learn something new thank you You see, if my school offered decent italian classes me learning wouldnt be a problem are you itailan? Voglio meno is useful, usually as Italians we serve a lot of food like 10x more than average, honestly When your family is from Italy but you were born in America so u don‚Äôt know Italian ŸÅÿ™ÿ™ ÿ®ÿØÿßŸÅÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ∂ŸàŸÑ Me pare che uno deve prima imparare l'italiano per dopo insegnarlo.

I'm not sure if it is me, but a lot of french words sound the same, like voice, want, see, and I think there are others, so actually hearing someone say those words a loud might be helpful.
I'm not sure how useful or easy it would be to just learn french like this, but it is fun to listen to her talk. it's like talking with a friend;

üë©üë±üëè Your amazing thank you for doing this language in both ASL and BSL Hey guys,
As a hearing person I am disappointed in the response from the channel after reading the comments section.  However,  instead of not doing anything we can help take this down by reporting this video as misleading to Google.
Pls do this if possible.  Let's stop this injustice to our deaf friends!


After reporting the video it would be great if u would leave a comment showing your support! I don't know anyone deaf but what's the harm if me learning sign language can help someone specially abled mmmmmmmm and I don't know what I did Thank GOD a community of ASL people are here! I would have made a fool of myself Tiene muchos errores las se√±as thx i want to study sign language in comments everyone says this video is wrong pls give me link or something i need to know sign language ALMOST ALL OF THIS IS WRONGü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ THIS IS HORRIBLE I HATE THIS TAKE THIS VIDEO OF THE ENTIRE INTERNET NOWü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ I WAS SO EXITED TO LEARN ASLüò≠ Incredible video.

I learned "I love you" from the a quiet placee This video should be deleted I didn't look at the comments before I started memorizing, but I'm glad I saw some other videos before this. I thought something was fishy when the "mother" sign was different from what I've seen. its my pleasure to meet you Victoria I‚Äôm  deaf! I like ASL! ASL errors:

Mother (she signed grandmother)
Father (she signed grandfather)
Family ( ‚ÄúBSL‚Äù sign for ‚Äúfamily‚Äù is ASL for ‚Äúfamily‚Äù)

I am good (correct sign of ‚Äúgood‚Äù: 1:31)
Facebook (We don‚Äôt really have a sign for that so we spell ‚ÄúFB‚Äù)

I am just at the stage when I need to hear spoken french without it being part of a lesson, but am unable to understand proper conversations. This is perfect! Thank you! Very good Hey Ouino how did you get our gmail? If you would have added English Sentences in audio. So we could listen while doing other activities too. This video is really helpful. Thank you Directions 40:00 Now haters will say it's 1hour 4 second long ‡≤†_‡≤† Thank you for offering this free intro to Ouino French. I was puzzled about the course strategy after listening to the first short conversation that goes for the normal speed with liaison then slower speed to individual words. Anyway, the contents are very practical and useful. Thanks. What does vns means in French? "Quelques-vns ne la divisent qu-en deux fortes de Peuples, en Turcomans, & Curdes" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Merci , c‚Äôest tr√®s facile üåπüòç best french lesson so far! It runs in the backround everyday,  C'est super :) Je vais travellier, bonjourne√© monsieur/ monsieur. Au revoir! I can't get enough of you guys hihihi üòÇ Wawo i like this thanks and keep it up I dont get a single word when they speak at normal speed üòÖ It's  great  just  loving it Very good.Thank. waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaa It's  amazing  you speak  slowly  this will  help  me  while my school  close This is very helpful along with Forvo where I learn vocabulary & pronunciation with digital French flash cards. This is helpful for French students like me who sorta struggle in the listening department I love French language  ....but need to learn..‚ò∫ I am trying to learn french.  I am pulling my hair out!  Seems to me they took an excellent language (Latin) and went lazy on it.  Example: 'court' (cour), running, a single person.  This is very close pronunciation to the Latin corrit (pronounced corrit).  Multiple people running in french is courtent, prounced (cour).  WHAT!!?!?!?!?!  This is very close in spelling to the Latin corrent (pronounced corrent).   How do you ever tell what is singular and what is plural.  And what is with all the letters at the ends of the words that are just ignored.  It must be a nightmare to understand the spelling.  Might have to go back to Spanish, it has some strange stuff (ll, and useless h's) but not like French. Good! Tr√®s bien! Merci beaucoup. Very thanks! Tres bien Just great...I'm 68 and always wanted to learn French...when i was in high school we didn't have such learning tools.

I now realise that "Ciao" is an actual real word in Latvian (Darta's language) which means hello lmao 1:40, that woman from Easy german drinking Vodka LOL darta means fart in arabic I didn't like it so much, it seems to be messy - going in  random directions, and certainly not super easy for complete beginners. ok i ship him with Darta Who the hell invented this language?? wonderful lesson, thanks from Brazil For a dummy like me, this is a fun video to help learn French. My lockdown goal to learn a language has begun! So why exactly is the playlist in reverse order? It makes it impossible to play.

I listen to your lessons everytime I have a break at work. You are a very good teacher, you explain the things clearly and make everything easier. I also love your pronounciation. Thank you a lot! Merci beaucoup!üôèüèº omg 8 hours how much effort was put in this video French isn't as difficult as everyone thinks we learn French in the third year of primary school Is it just 6 units for beginners, or which videos goes next?? I am interested in why you broke with your tradition of presenting examples for Masculine, Feminine, and Plurals in your "Les demonbstrufs"  lesson. As you omit the Plurals. in "expression de la quantite" you have suddenly decided not to give any example sentences/ I think this is a mistake. You should continue to do  this a a good procedure for presentation of new information. Secondly you call attention to the noun being "sans article". If I think about a sentence in English, I don't feel a need for an article. So there must be a reason why you call attention to this matter. When you call attention to a point in your presentation  you should explain it, because certainly the listeners will question your emphasis. It is not good teaching practice "to leave issues hanging". You forgot to add "pas" after the verb, or you didn't explain why it is omitted your video is the best on net thank you very much. just at first when you teaching give us more example for beginners many thanks mate. your video is the best on net thank you very much. just at first when you teaching give us more example for beginners many thanks mate I notice that beginning with the leson "Les questions" you stop pointing out the leisons between spoken words beginning with vowels. As a new student, I think this is a pity that you decided to do this, as I need some help in this area because I am a new learner. IF I were studying at a higher level this could be taken for granted, and it would save your voice as well not to need to mention this spoken linking.

I would really thank you because your lessons not only helped me but it also helped many of my colleagues too since 2014 and still going on as we work in Africa region were it is only French and we had only the knowledge of English so again MERCI BEAUCOUP MON CH√âRI AMI.. How would you pronounce my name Monserrat in French ? I am from Egypt and your videos helped me a lot thanks :) Hello Vincent
Please use english words / sentences along with the french words or sentences that you use here as an example.
Your examples are very clear , but it will help to see english letters/ sentence along s with your french letters/ words... which will help create a picture in mind and relate them together.
Inspite of me finding it a little difficult to follow without the english words, i still find your videos are the best among others that are available in Youtube.
Thank you for your videos, however hoping to get something i am looking for. Thanks for the video. It helps. Thank you very much . I found it most easy way to learn  French . Vincent vous offrez des skype lecons? si oui, combien euro? d√©sol√© pour moi mauvais fran√ßais lol I'm really appreciate with your French lessons. It's very helpful. I'm a beginner level, just started learning. It would be very kind of you if you could make a video of French pronunciation that we could see your mouth's movement and transcription at the same time. I can hear you pronouncing but I still have trouble moving my mouth. Anyway I'll try my best. Thank you so much. :) j'adore votre methodologie d'enseignement Mr V Danke sch√∂n! Thank you so much for this tutorial, it helped a lot! ^^ Merci pour cette vid√©o. Je l'utilise pour me r√©viser, ma langue fran√ßaise. Bonjour Vincent! Thank you for all our time and dedication in sharing this beautiful language without expecting any returns. Merci beacoup! merci beaucoup Is there a lot of differences between the French spoken in French and Quebec? BTW, this is very helpful merci beacoup! :) How would you say Zoe in French I'm trying to piece it together thank you, very very good :) (y) I am very passionate to learn different languages and want to be able to speak french fluently , i have searching for means for that and somehow i ended up here and only thing i find troublesome is , the videos are extremely lengthy also you jump from one lesson to another, i don't understand where to use those Accents that i just learned, like i need more examples to what , why and how! please don't take it personal i m eager to know more and more, need more help than i can get. 5-12 very good sir, u r help a lots you are good..but french is too complicated :( You are the best! Thank you so much for your videos In my French class we learned "y" as "i grec " why wasn't it included here? excelentee!! The tutor does not say the English meaning of the words in maximum cases.. So over all its a good effort tutorial ...  Its good to learn how to make the pronunciation mainly rather than learning new sentences and words... This could have been a very good tutorial... I hate when you talk alot someone please help me understand. what is the difference between using moi, toi, lui etc and using me, te, le/la pronoms COD?  I don't get it. if you know, will you please really break ot down for me. thank you! This will be a great chance to practice my French! Now I have a motivation to learn it,because I am studying in university and there is an "Erasmus" programme that lets students come to other countries to study in their universities! And now I've met an interesting French girl so it will be more interesting to try talk to her in French. Of course,she understand English,but not as well as French.  Merci! merci ;) niceIt is the pronunciation I can‚Äôt learn Spanish so I‚Äôm learning French I guess Very informative. I am learning French in school. It helps. Merci.....

Great  programe even for  recreational or tertiary support ,I am very much impressed. Suis-je le seul ici pour qu'ils puissent am√©liorer notre fran√ßais Merci ‚ù§Ô∏è That was so Amazing I dont understand French and I never want to learn it. im glad because its an absolutely imperialistic country, and its shameful how they invaded and drove to extinction all the native culture and languages of the people whom they conquered, mostly assimilated in current France. French is not native to even 50% of the french territory, yet they ensure it is the countries language, while the actual original languages of current French land are treated as "non-existant" by France. Also, their speakers have no rights, only the right to shut up and become extinct. This is a cultural and linguistic genocide, still going on nowadays, and almost completed by "France". They just made sure by force, law, the media and the French state to eradicate their languages and cultures. Thats a true cultural and linguistic genocide, what the french carried out and still carry out nowadays. I laugh at the equality principle in France, sure were all equal as long as u speak French and abandon the original culture of ur own land and people, so u can become fully assimilated by France. I hope the day comes when France gets judged for the cultural and linguistic genocides it carried out within its borders. They almost drove to extinction occitan, alsacian, corsican, basque, catalan and breton in France, the original language spoken in the lands they now inhabit and whose people have by force and pressure abandoned their forefathers culture and language. Completely assimilated their people by the force of law and making they feel inferior for not as quoted "being clean & speaking french". Shame to France! Please show respect and learn the original languages of the land which u invaded and whose people u mistreated, to amend for ur crimes. Ill never learn such a disgraceful language as I think France is a disgraceful country.

It's very useful   Cheers mate Great lessons. Really helpful. Thank you. Thanks for the video. Its very well done and very helpful.

Gracias. Great video, great teacher. great tip for making the correct "u" sound is making a "u" sound and "oooh" sound at the same time. Why would he not put the English there to explain what it means though. I feel like I'm learning french words without the meanings. Unless that happens later. the way you said ''www'' made me watch my lang more! :)) mercii <3 ¬†btw just one tip to people who learn french as second language, its that don't go hard on urself, i mean i've seen some of my friends learning french they kind a like make this weird face to get the accent, just try to make it normal, you have to make it very simple by not making sound so difficult, its actually easy if u get it once! u can do it! :)) lol im french but idk how 2 speak it

Btw guys, pouvoir is a verb. Not the object. This ain't what we need.

1. We need the articles so we know the gender of the words.
2. These ARE NOT useful words. We need to know the 200 most useful words that we'd use every day. I'm pretty sure air conditioner ain't one of those. i learned that in speaking french you need to learn how to speak cursive Appreciate you handwork, but next time please mention the gender, it makes it even better and helpful! lol This is not a good dictionary.

This channel is really nice üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç Hi, I‚Äôm just came for watching your nice video but I wasted time by creating account for free French sheets from a link that you mentioned , you should keep honest in your work , you lied that it is free ,I‚Äôm proud of those people they don‚Äôt  lie that their service is free.

Where are the articles? It does give weight to the argument  of just saying everything with a French accent, "le passport" "le telephone" "le email" ingl√™s: passport
franc√™s: passa porra It would be nice to learn all these words with articles. would be better if the gender is included French. English very difficult And English I know very well I learn french   fighting ÊÄß„ÅåÂàÜ„Åã„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ„Å®‰Ωø„Åà„Å™„ÅÑ **French person speaking fluent French**

Knowing the word is useless without knowing if it is masculine or feminine. LA KOUIZINEi feel like for beginners it may be too fast. Some very random sentences great...thank you for the time it toke to make this i wish my employer know this Genial, ingl√©s y franc√©s a la vez! ü§£‚ú® üëç it is really cool that she/ he speak normal the phrases and it doesnt sound like he/ she is talking slowly.
P.d there a lot of phrases that i can understand beacuse i speak spanish as well. I am excited This is maybe for slightly after beginners... is this Canadian French? If learning French, you should put this language at last (by repeating it from slow speed to normal) to keep it lasting in our memory forever. One of the best. Keep on. Thanks Very useful and clear lesson. Thank you. 8:40- 30 This is super good I like type of vedio lessons Thanks a lot for sharing!!

Can you make it without English audio please? I'm doing a French app its hard but I'm improving Merci beaucoup Is this a real person speaking (the French)? It sounds somewhat simulated to me? this is actually very helpful thank you Such a beautiful language. "J'ai la diarrhee"üòçüëå Ï¢ãÏïÑÏöî For beginners giving a loose translation rather than word for word gets in the way of learning the written language. Anyone else slow it down? It helped a lot. Its really fast and for a beginner u shud have made it a bit slower (just my opinion) Thanks now I can play minecraft with my friend and actually understand what he's saying hopefully Merci beacoup for this nightmare of french ü•ñüçüü•ñüçüü•ñüçü The speed can be adjusted too. Good for beginners until your ear gets attuned. I agree...finally something useful. Oh! This is FANTASTIC!! Just what I need! Thank you!!!!! Perfect! I have been learning a little bit at a time for twenty years. This is like after studying Spanish from books for ten years and my communication was poor,  then I went to Mexico for two months and I returned to the States speaking with total comprehension!  Awesome! the english speaker is a real karen Omelette du Fromage? really love it its makes you challenge yourself every single sentence...!

I tried again today (4 days after finishing Basic 2), manage to read it aloud (mostly correct compared to the audio) and understood 90% of the story. And to think that I thought I hardly learned anything in B1 & B2 (2 months of intensive). Tr√®s heureuse!! What is the app name please How is this for ‚Äùbeginners‚Äù?! I swear speaking french is harder then speaking japanese Why can't they just upload the other audios on Youtube. Such a pain to go Audible I've been learning languages since I was a kid....The thing that is frustratingly difficult about French is that the pronunciation is not true to the spelling because they leave out so many consonants. It's the thing that makes understanding spoken French so much harder but at the same time, it is what makes French sound so sophisticated and pleasant to the ear compared to all the other Romance languages combined!....:\ Une tr√®s belle histoire I love when someone speaks in French,I just get something inside and outside that I want too speak like that ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÅ and btw your voice is angelic ü§óüëå‚ù§Ô∏è very good story! I'm really a beginner. I don't know anything but i want to learn. How i need to start? Btw i'm not native in english but i try to learn french by english sources. I don't understand some english words so this is a little hard for me :( merci Obrigado pelo trabalho. Li hoje.

French learning in easy & interesting way. Watch if you want to learn Thanks üòä I know 4 languages fluently.

I loved the story but her voice was very irritating to me :( Ha ha ha is that for beginners ???? Belle histoire
En plus,elle est riche en vocabulaire exatamente dois anos depois! je ne pense pas que ces histoires courtes soient pour les d√©butants. Ce sont plut√¥t pour le nouveau interm√©diaire. Du coup, c'est la pr√©sentation tr√®s utile et int√©ressante pour moi. Merci beaucoup.

For French Video Lecture courses - www.LearnFrenchBySuchita.com Kotti Can I be fluent in French Language with your channel's video? Or is it just basics? I have been learning French from duliongo app but now I watched a your video To kese ho aap Mam iam beginer You have put virtual background. Mam why g is writed or pronounced as g only in the word ‚Äújaguar‚Äù in french ????? ü•¥ or same in case of Kangourou A- aim Wow what a teaching style oi just love it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüéâüéâüéâüéâüåπüåπüåπüåπüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üôÇ It's very useful video thank you so much You teach so well mam and again thank you so much Thank you for your very amazing explanation and you explain very well and it's very useful for beginner like me and I am 10 year old learning French...........

Thanks I learned all letters Can elephant üêò be written as elephon in French like avion and dindon..?üôÑas  it's pronounciation is similar to these words.. Highly useful video!! I checked many videos to learn the same, but this is the one that helps me a lot as the pronunciation is shown in Hindi. I just finished the first page (a-i). Just a suggestion.. I learnt the pronunciation of French 'R' from some other video before watching this video. Would it be better if the Hindi 'ra' in the video is replaced by 'kha' as in 'khargosh' or 'ha' as in 'havaa', so that it is more accurate than Hindi 'ra' as in 'ravi'? Ok I know that R is hard to pronounce & funny also üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ Thank you so much mam but can I ask you something actually I have some doubts can u plz clear it..!!

Found my "French in Action" videos to watch again, and now these, which I didn't see originally, are a great addition. Really appreciate the uploads! man french shop keepers are kinda douchy. J'ai crois que il ne y a pas voulant de banque dan la france these lessons are the best, haha What a hag 16:10 May I know the actors' names, please? I really like this. More videos, please and thank you. Like itüëç Is it only me finding it useful more than nowadays methods of teaching languages?! merci Thank you, I have just started the course, it's verry helpful! I cracked I love these!  Merci beaucoup ! thank you so much my teacher for this  course ! you make me able to speak french vry easily I came across these videos last summer and made my son watch them before he started taking French in high school. I can honestly say that he learned a lot from this video course. Thank you so very much for sharing! As a teacher of foreign languages myself, I really admire how these lessons are made; without much efforts one picks up vocabulary, reading tips, correct pronunciation, and a bit of grammar. Brilliant! I actually liked this course so much that I bought the book to go with it. From the book, I learned that there was also a cartoon and a soap opera to go along the book as well as a radio course (tapes). I wish I could get all of them. By the way, the actress who plays Madame Dupont in the very first skit played two French-speaking characters in the famous British TV show "Upstairs Downstairs". Je amour cette video. C'est tres bon. Marci Beacoup. 7:19 Blood!
YouTube hasn't taken this down? Je trouve cette video tres utile!  Merci beaucoup pour la partager! What does the girl say at 7:36?? I hope, i will be able to speak French very good, thank you so much üëè Thanks The film quality is so poor that it appears to open with with the Italian flag. anyone knows the actors name ?? https://youtu.be/lwYfT9tZsrg Merci beaucoup The girl  in 8:48 is the same girl  who  presents a french course for the BBC called " A vous la France"  a old one, from the eights French in Action was another good series awwww well  thank you so very very much for wanting to share this with us  we really do appreciate it big tyme.  :) i lyke this  french course too i been watching this 1  not long but  i lyke it  yeah merci   :) Such a great production no doubt made before not long after we were taken into the brainwashing machine known as the EU. The characterization of frog people is well observed here and it depicts a French context that is believable and if not overtly attractive is still very charming. Our current troupe of remain zelouts  would never permit or allow such an honest and free depiction of a foreign nations to be broadcast on the BBC of today.    Also the language teaching is well judged and not patronizing since there are many similarities between French and English. Its just that the middle class and upper class of Britain would have us believe that French is only for educated Britons. 
Don't just take my word with contrast this tour de force with the language teaching s;;;'t the BBC were pumping out in the mid 90s which was just a wet dream to appease the desires of bored accountants. 
oui j'ai eu une longue branlette de penser aux femmes qui ont jou√© l'infirmi√®re stroppy :)
FUCK THE LIBERIAL DEMOCRATS AND ALL THE FACIST PIECES OF SHIT FORCING THE NATION TO A SECOND COSTLY REFRENDUM !!! Merci beaucoup At the skit at 9:25 is the actor who is the theif Andr√© Maranne?!? He was in the pink panther Am learning a lot from this...wow! Impressive! Great series Very helpful for me thanks a lots for your support and sharing this beautiful lesson. Merci beaucoup üòò üòò üòò üòò. these lessons are much more better than the lessons we buy with money. These tapes are a tremendous instructional for french beginners as myself.I must thank you sir immensely for sharing, This is yet the best Methode de francais I ever came across and still use today for practising French Brilliant! Why does he say "fierement gar√ßon" ?  Not familiar with this expression BBC stopped making any more TV language programs, pity This is actually pretty funny I am Eritrea and I like this program Parfait üëåüëåüëå C'est tr√®s bien pour moi ce video I love the intro; a Europe now going. found this from the book my grandma gave me, ensemble 1 french for beginners Carolle Rousseau, voulez vous etre ma femme? Thank you very much for uploading these!! C'est parfait! J'adore le video. Merci beaucoup! ‚ù§ The way the actors portray personality types you'd come across in France is spot on , also the fact that it does not patronise the learner and is realistically  enacted  is great too. This is excellent much better then the modern travel loge type programs that have passed for language courses in recent years which are just aimed at middle class consumers. please make more videos.. Merci beaucoup pour cette video qui Legend qui I like it Bonjour, Ensemble French!
Super!
Merci et √† bient√¥t. 
Brasil 2018. This was the best French course I have ever taken. I came across my books and wondered if the tapes were still available. I am grateful to the person who put these on YouTube. Thank you. c'est tr√®s bien Only a few of the videos uploaded in their channel. Need more. J'ai √©tudi√© le fran√ßais il y a trois ans, j'ai ador√© cette vid√©o, tr√®s bonne, pour les √©tudiants de langue fran√ßaise. Merci d'avoir post√© cette vid√©o. Je suis br√©silien. Fun to learn language nice Merci! Hahahah! I laugh so hard at the song called "Je ne sais pas" that was funny I feel bad I dont know these actors. They're  before my time XD This is really awesome. I am enjoying this video a lot. Thank you, obrigado, merci beaucoup! Merci beaucoup Merci beaucoup. What's the music playing at 10:30? amour je suis ¬†dolly massion these old videos are the best for the beginners haha Probably the best ever French language course on BBC... ever. What's happened over the past 30 years... The BBC used to produce brilliant German, Spanish and Italian courses too... They were always supported by equally superb radio broadcasts too. The next stages I think were Sur le vif and Allez France. Also Franc Parler, France Extra and A vous  la France. Learnt so much French from these superb courses. Beaucoup merci j adore la programe Merci 8:14 Naughty nurse. Mon dieu! Elle est tr√®s belle! Comment s'appelle-t-elle? And that is one hell of a bank robbery, that is :-) Bonne continuation....Bravo Bonne continuation....Bravo One of the actors I think was in the "Gourmet Night" episode of Fawlty Towers! He's playing the long-haired customer at minute 16. Merci am looking for women of practice French +255767901170 This is the first time I see someone getting robbed like that. Bon bon √ßa va lolololol I love it! its fun to watch and easy to understand!

Im not demotivating you. From my personal experience,If anybody wants to learn foreign language except English, Please learn in English. For Example, If you need to speak German or french, Study in English, because most of the grammatical structures are much differ from English.So you can easily identify difference and learn it quickly. Thus you may  get good fluency in English too. Sir, your videos are extremely helpful. Though my English is good, I get to learn a lot from your videos because your French pronunciation is so perfect and easy to understand as you keep writing in Hindi. Thank you!

U are really great üòáüòáüòáüòá E ko Kya bolye hai Sir aur bhi video daalo Love to speak.... In our village almost everyone know english, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, Portuguese...... Nice, sir I gotten well Sir 26 alphabet ka French me pronunciation alag alag likh de please! hi Thank you sir for teaching in Hindi... Thanks Sir Please SPANISHI will learn 8 languages If you speak with a Belgian you can say septante for 70 et nonante for 90, its easier 71= septante et un; 72= septante deux, 91=nonante et un, 92= nonante deux :)! Bonne chance, passez en Belgique une fois ! Learn 8-10 languages and you will have a common language with most people in the world :D i just found this very useful and easy thank you  seriously!!!! ! The French number system is so retarded -.- It's impossible to learn speaking like she's doing it :C For people like me who has to repeat this 1000x times before they understand 0-10
0:27  soo anooying that there is no numbers just for 70 , 80 and ninety they have to be very confusing dont they :) Tanks this is very handy  you talk very clear! nice  ;((WHY CAN'T WE ALL HAVE THE SAME LAGUAGE!!!!! @musliminuk1 According to French grammar, the final /t/ in vingt is pronounced for numbers 21-29 inclusive. (French Grammar and Usage, Hawkins and Towell, p.137.) she looks like my teacher, @StudyFrench are you called miss valles? very good teacher!
I'am from greece and i wish i have teacher like you to study my french
thank you for suport
 thank  u Rita u hve helped me nderstand it more thn my teacher
 brilliant help with french homework @Stevanop no this video has revealed to me what to me what six years of schooling could not!!
 Its more easy when you go to a french immersion school. :) @learnfrenchvideos yea, y cant they just say '60' instead of 'watever bla bla bla' uggh @foxgirl100 AHH we have a french test tomorow and we ave to be able to count to 100 in french, GOD DAMN IT'S SOOOO HARD, I can get to 50, then I hate the french laguage from then on. >:( cheers that was helpfull Why do french numbers from 60-100 have to be so complicated?  ...the french numbers are like danish numbers....not that they are the same....but french and danish numbers got  peculiar logic.... Soooo difficult ohhh my godddd now i see when ppl want to learn english and i find it sooo easy if they are having a time like this its bad cause even my head hurts cause of how hard im thinking lol and teacher your are really good looking by the way(though it doesn't help me concentrate : /) French people from france say 60-10, 4-20, 4-20-10 for 70,80 and 90.
But french from Swisserland and Belgian have one word for 70,80,90 wich is easier to learn. They say "septante" (70) "Huitante" (80) and "Nonante" (90) don't pronounce the "e" @musliminuk1 You pronounce the "t" only if you have a word after, to make a liasion.However, you can pronounce the "t" with the word "vingt" alone, some people do that, like people from quebec, Swisszerland or Belgian. @kutie808bebe i know its so annoying. why cant they just have a word for 70, 80 & 90? instead u gotta say 60 & 10, 4 twenty, and so on... confuuuuuuusing! Con esa profesora voy a aprender r√°pido! (....mamacita!!!!!) ele dit "th" a onze douze treize @RockPop1337 AT* I know this might be inappropriate but goddamit she's cute. :) Thanks for the memory. I studied French for 4 months and I found it hard to learn. It's hear and there for me. But then again, I speak Spansih, some Italian, English, and French excellent! studied French for seven years so I'm fine with the numbers but this video is great for working on pronunciation.It was so helpful thnx‚ô°‚ô°‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Nicely taught my dear not teachedüòó I like u well? Heureux? Seriously? They couldn't find a simpler weird? I mean word üòÇ I'm sorry but it sounds like a computerized voice butchering somebody's name! Heureux, the pronunciation is out of this world! I luv it when people use this in conversations with a straight face! I just can't pronounce it! Editing this comment (think of the word 'error' heureux sounds like badly pronounced 'error') btw this isn't me poking fun at it, in the beginning yes I was poking fun at it. I can't pronounce heureux :( Merci Love these lessons! Really makes learning French so much easier! Thanks so much ‚ù§Ô∏è Even if learning french is difficult with d√©termination u van do it Merci beaucoup;) A bientot! Merci beaucoup üëåüèø Merci beaucoup It's very useful !! For a beginner without any fundation, it's suitable. merci Thanks a lot for teaching me French :-) I think for a foreigner the word endings aren't that big a deal; there are only a few of them that result in a different sound, and beginners would likely be give a pass. They differences between¬†the orthography and pronunciation of a word only become apparent, of course,¬†in¬†the written form, and seem to be¬†as irregular as hell. Exellent! Exellent! thank u so much coz it helped a lot but pronunciation still aproblem Merci, la tante Lol my prononciation is great but I can‚Äôt freakin read Really nicely teached with pronunciation. I appreciate I think the lesson jumps too quickly on from lesson one.  There needs to be a balance between learning verb structure and pronouns and some new vocabulary. merci je t'aime bien lesson lol Great job keep those videos coming! Je t'aime plus! Good  working 
good. merci , je t'aime *the lesson* beaucoup Nice lesson Je suis tres content....  perfect lesson..üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ merci,a bientot Merci, je t'aime bien! üòä IDl t  ST Merci beaucoup!!! merci Really good lessons,  merci! This is bloody difficult but it's entertaining .   I appreciate your efforts could please send me more items coz am desperate to learn French. I'm going to make vocabulary/flash cards. It's very clear, but my tongue can't help The grammar and the pronunciation are frustating! Actually, I think "beaucoup" means "alot" 1:20 Looks like Paul Young lol I can read some things in French, but the pronouncing really just sets me off, why are the words pronounced so different from what they look like ,  oh its not easy but i'll give a try >__< can you make the alphabets sound fist¬† so¬†I can¬†sounded better ?
I want to learn¬†Italian so badly
and other language and I will love to teaching you¬†Indonesian or Balinese :)¬† Mister Tanks¬†a Lot¬†God blees¬†you¬† Also, I saw someone a while back asked about "it is". In case anyone else ends up wondering, it is "il est" (same as "he is"). @ninjaturtles12121 @smellycatrulesxX It is because the e at the end of "elle" is not pronounced. The confusion is due to the rule not being properly explained: It's not that every word ending in a vowel needs a ' for the liaison, it's that any word ending in a vowel SOUND needs ' for a liaison. So it is "elle est" not "ell'est". that's awesome.tx "on" is more familiar than "nous", so you can use 'on' when you speak to your friend for example. bon travail I think it's because "Elle est" they both end in the same vowel "e" so they don't consider it to be a clash of the vowels. I don't know if that's right, though.  In "Elle est contente" shouldn't that be Ell' est contente? b/ of the two clashing vowels based on ur prev lesson? I am confused can some1 explain this please. best lessons ever!!!! Merci, this is one of the best videos for French beginners. namaste ..... 
SHUBA-PRABHAT (NEPALI) - GOOD MORNING (ENGLISH) - BONJOUR (FRENCH)  merci beaucoup* :) MERCI BEAUCOUP Well, "on" is impersonnal, like "il" can be sometimes. But there is a strong tendancy to use "on" the same way you would say "we", but it's not traditionnal, it's not "proper" French, but I get we'll have to update our grammar rules soon... Of course, and I'd say the same thing for Spanish, since I speak French and I'm learning Spanish. El vocabulario que es percivido "antiguo" en franc√©s es acutal en castellano y viceversa. Do you know that French (and perhaps everyone that speaks French) don't see Paris as the city of romance (only for the tourists) ? For us, it's Venice only. une gomme √† effacer (international), une efface (Qu√©bec), assuming you're talking for an eraser you would use with a pencil. gomme

It is weird for French persons too but if you don't say "le" it is VERY weird :p my stupid french teacher gave me a 50 year old textbook which is in all french n its been like 2 weeks.. how the hell does she expect me to find the time chapter if i cant read man the "heures" part is hard to pronounce  this is so helpful Finally , Finally I understand.

Je viens de encontre ton Channel y je crois et tr√®s utile. you made it so short and simple thank you. The name of this video should have been "how to ask yes or no questions". Nice work! Aujourd'hui, j'ai enfin comprend le french! Merci! Dick i dont like language lol but this helps a ton Excellent teaching...better than alexa... the best french tutor on youtube....keep it up. When your teacher asks you to watch this and complete the worksheet- but there is no worksheet- EST - CE QUE VOUS PARELES  ANGLAIS ? I doubt anyone will see or respond to this question, but on the off-chance someone does... is it always "est-ce que"? Could this ever be replaced by something else? Too good Estaba confundida gracias por las tres maneras explicadas ü§ó muy bien! Merci beaucoup This is our first fucked In the beginning of video I thought she would speak  'we're going to APPRENDRE LOL This is useful. However the ‚Äòf‚Äô in fran√ßais should not be in capital letter. I wonder how she looks now Good job Techeare but why shart 12 hours before my exams Apprendre le fran√ßais autrement

Elle parle fran√ßais. Elle est fran√ßaise. But " elle est une Fran√ßaise". I want to think she's French but I'm getting Mexican vibes Ya like jazz.IntoYa like jazz?

Or is the A1 test harder than this? I got only 8 options wrong in the whole the exercise Transcription?? Mer√ßi! I take my DELF exam today. It help me so much.

Thank you! –úerci beaucoup!!! Beaucoup Merci beau coupon This conversation is too fast
For beginners .
Please do the conversation video beginners can understand. ca fait combien does mean literally it makes how much (How much is that). Simply sentence mapping isn't sufficient to learn the language. Word to word mapping is important and when you put a different sentence you pull that person back from learning by teaching wrong equivalences as he will try to use the words elsewhere. But I have to tell this is one of the best videos. Even french people videos don't seem to be as good as this.So my request is put (Literally : it makes how much, Verbally : How much is it). It will be the best. ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá Ÿäÿ®ÿßÿ±ŸÉ ŸÅŸäŸÉ Ÿàÿ¥ŸÉÿ±ŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ≤ŸäŸÑÿß üôã üôã üôã üëç üëç üëç üëç üíñ üíõ üëå üëå üëå üëå Merci Monsieur Merci beaucoup super vid√©o .... vraiment ador√© .... merci beaucoup Merci !!!!!!!

(I never studied Mandarin, so I don't know if it's a cool language or not, but I think it is). :) morenita0031, that's is mean. I'm learning French atm, thank you for getting me started allez-vous Merci pour cette vid√©o. ¬†Je viens de la partager avec un groupe d'√©tudiants am√©ricains avant qu'ils n'arrivent en France. je ne parle pas francais REALY comment tu t'appelles morenita0031 I love French!!!!!!!! Thnx a lot for this video.It is very helpful for the beginners.. The problem with french is that while you have a bulk of words, you are required to pronounce it as few words. this is a disgusting language... There's a little pronounciation mistake for "comment" in "comment vous appelez-vous", but it's good, I can hear you are not French, but it's very good. I am french and half of those words are wrong! Lol DUHHHH Mon ami is a word you forgot
 Well I hate Mandarin.But I think French looks more interesting to learn because its a beautiful language I agree i love french!!If you like my lessons, keep in mind that the YouTube videos are just the visible part of the iceberg... The full curriculum with videos to go from level A1 to level B2, Ibooks, Ebooks, Apps, printable PDFs, Online Quizzes, and much more...

Merci :) thats definatly not easy":) Started learning french about a week ago, helpya boi out, any tips? This is just slightly above my level so its very helpful! Thanks! i hate learning french smdh freakin canadian schools Can't understand üòòüò≠üò≠üò≠ Plz more tales I pretty much didn't understand a single thing from this 'Story for Begginers' One day soon, I‚Äôll be able to understand all of this. Je l'adore! Me changing the speed of the video to 0.75... XD Please put the English beside the French I want to know if I'm reading it right For a beginners story, you tell it too fast!! I thought I was listening to an intermediate story and not a beginners telling!! It sucked!! Tr√®s douce! Merci! je ne comprends pas :[ Difficle ;-; Most teachers don't understand the process of language acquisition. Beginners need to understand, not every word, but need to feel that they can understand most of the time what's going on, what's the story is about.  If little children don't get the message, their parents will simply say it again in a simple manner. There's interaction so parents get feedback and clues about their children's level of comprehension. With that information they can try better to communicate and adjust the pace and the level of the language so their child gets to understand the meaning of the words and sentences. Parents naturally do what is necessary to facilitate comprehension. By reading comments here I have confirmation that this video is not well adjusted for beginners. Too difficult. If I understand everything and know all the words, what level does this make me? Yes I am still not able to understand this story , who is learning through Duolingo ????????????? Thank you! This is going to be excellent practice. I have a LONG way to go before I understand. Just the practice I need!!! but we need translation too Please slowly Ive been taking French for 11 years and I still don't understand any of this let's talk guys .I don't know french.But i will learn.Let's talk and help each other I think by beginner they don‚Äôt mean your first year in French because I‚Äôm in level 3 and this is the sort of stuff we‚Äôre learning easy to understand This isn't for beginners Her voice is fantastic and she speaks very fast and that's very good (my opinion) But first day of school is premier jour d‚Äôcole so is la rentr√©e des classes is just another way of saying it This is great!

This really helped thanks!! i love it when you lick your lips at 1:50 in the video üòÖü§§ en Fran√ßais on dit 'DANS LA RUE" et non SUR LA RUE(C'est du Franglais) do you have boyfriend ? ::D Vous parlez vraiment bien fran√ßais Nice Tu es adorable i appreciate you that giving a classes through youtube. I m not here to judge you. cause i m learning french. you are doing very good...but there are some mistakes.don't thing about there people cause you are helping those people who can' afford a fee for class. my french teacher teach me that pres de means near.
 first pres de means near (a cote de means next to). Je vous remercie A point noone realized; at one point she said "tournez √† gauche" while she had to say"tournez √† droite"! It's at 4:10 thank you madam Merci beaucoup thanx dear Rita I hate salon En face de... I thought was "opposite"  in front of is " devant de..." and next to is a cote de.... and entre... inbetween.... as taraonmsp said you are way better than my french teacher You are really wonderful. This kind of video at last I found. Merci yes she is. ..! thank you very much lady " I think that your lessons are so useful.

just keep going please THANKS A LOT YOU ARE GREAT Merci beaucoup Rita. 
il a √©t√© tr√®s instructif, u r amazing thanks for ur efforts <3 4:06 lol Merci ! You're soo much better than my french teacher xD thx Muy buen video, gracias!! very effective....you get the point!!!...thx. Nice lecturer Bon professeur.¬†¬† ;) i like it class but i want more class Is this what is called "French Canadian" (or vice versa)?
Some of these expressions are not what I am used to. I don't want to say that they are *wrong*, but just not what I was taught, and I have not heard any French people speaking like this. I am mostly familiar with a Parisian accent, and also the Corsican accent.
From which part of France (or francophonia) do you hail? what a wonderful channel! There are mistakes in this video.¬† For example, pres de does not mean 'next to'.¬† It means 'near'.¬† Next to, is 'a cote de' (no accents on my laptop, sorry!).¬† Also the spelling mistake of bibliotheque.¬†¬† Also, en face de means 'opposite', not 'in front of'.¬† In front of, is 'devant' .¬† Too many mistakes. There are spelling mistakes.  Correct spelling for: Biblioth√®que.  M√©tro. I enjoy these lessons . They are very informative. Here is a small point on the directions.To get to the bank from the school you would have to be walking backwards. So in fact when you face the correct way instead of turning left at rue de bloor you would turn right.  merci pour votre lesson! salutations brasilien! (est que ce correct?)
 wow french people are so arrogant about their language!! get over yourselve if you think that she is not good enough to teach french then you should be teaching, that would really help others to learn your language as it should be...take care :)  with all the due respect.., why are you surprised? she's doing the best... if you're an expert in french language why don't you teach by yourself and stop criticizing her? Its bibliotheque


 Hello learners , 

I am french native speaker and I am surprised to see someone teaching french ( who obviously is not french because of her accent ),  on the board behind her there are 2 spelling mistakes !! In french we write "biblioth√®que" and "m√©tro" like that . Some advice if you want to learn a foreign language , take a native speaker , a spanish for spanish language , an english for english language .... thanks for the video, thats my next lesson  Thank you for this video - I will definitely make it available to my students.  Please don't mind this comment, but you might want to note that biblioth√®que (shown on the dry erase board in the first scene) is misspelled (it's missing the"h"). u tot helped me thx Merci beaucoup professeur. thanks for this vedios,they are really benifit to us
 You're so cool, man! 2:57 my favorite moment
 2:13
 hello mo mo
 Im listening to this in class woop im a rebel la poste on a tous a y gagner I think the "H" of biblioth√®que as been volountary "forgotten" to avoid confusion with the "th" sound in english... And I often use the shortened "la poste" instead of "le bureau de poste".... normaly, is ' dans la rue' and no 'sur la rue' ?
 THANKS.... THIS IS A  USEFUL CLASS...

I'm actually picking it up! Rita's good! she got swagger when teaching (snaps fingers) @donnecoeur I think 'droit' is only used in the context 'tout droit', which means 'straight'. The word 'droite' however, means 'right'.  
Tout droit = straight 
Droite = right. Thank you for a great lesson- I really enjoy your style - I can wait for more videos ..  regards 
Nissim Cohen New Zealand  You can teach me all French you want babe with that pretty smile. haha true ;) but its a little mistake :) The insruction for heading south from the school to the bank and turning left is confusing, does nort sound correct. Pres l'ecole, continuez tout droit sur la rue  Bloor et tournez a gouche. C'est ne tournez  pas droite.?  Using an example of headinfg north and turning left would be easier to undrerstand.Merci merci beaucoup ‚ô°you can make your intro like Korea unni Superb way of teaching French loved it.

 Please I will like to learn everything in French Mucho bla bla bla en ines You're looking different from before Lya Lya you are so pretty,I love you so much. üòçüòçthe way she teaches üå∏üëè Je suis visage laid. üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå  ‡§è‡§ï‡•ç‡§∏‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü ‡•§ I find her interesting..flat face no jokes learning time ..onto the point... I dont understand French and I never want to learn it. im glad because its an absolutely imperialistic country, and its shameful how they invaded and drove to extinction all the native culture and languages of the people whom they conquered, mostly assimilated in current France. French is not native to even 50% of the french territory, yet they ensure it is the countries language, while the actual original languages of current French land are treated as "non-existant" by France. Also, their speakers have no rights, only the right to shut up and become extinct. This is a cultural and linguistic genocide, still going on nowadays, and almost completed by "France". They just made sure by force, law, the media and the French state to eradicate their languages and cultures. Thats a true cultural and linguistic genocide, what the french carried out and still carry out nowadays. I laugh at the equality principle in France, sure were all equal as long as u speak French and abandon the original culture of ur own land and people, so u can become fully assimilated by France. I hope the day comes when France gets judged for the cultural and linguistic genocides it carried out within its borders. They almost drove to extinction occitan, alsacian, corsican, basque, catalan and breton in France, the original language spoken in the lands they now inhabit and whose people have by force and pressure abandoned their forefathers culture and language. Completely assimilated their people by the force of law and making they feel inferior for not as quoted "being clean & speaking french". Shame to France! Please show respect and learn the original languages of the land which u invaded and whose people u mistreated, to amend for ur crimes. Ill never learn such a disgraceful language as I think France is a disgraceful country. I really understand much better with your method; the systematic way in which it is designed for new Students of the French Language allowed me to learn it very easy.
Thanks for your great methodüëç Who still says "mademoiselle" or "mon ami" in 2021 ? old people maybe Your French so good I am also learning french How often do you think bon gets misspelled as bom in French Google searches - for example, a ‚Äògood‚Äô tower :/ or a word from the 30% shared from French Lya, COMMENT VAS-TU. , Ca Fait Longtemps!.. where is your personality? this is not fun to learn anymore.. Thanks üëç so much for the lesson it really understanding D: Some times I speak this in public. In spelling slowly in order to understand. Don't be fast. Ok? I hate you @guy who bosses around and changes people. Bonjour Everyone Glad i can say "visage laid" now. üëåüëç :( aww she‚Äôs so serious I doubt whether this was Lya Nd I‚Äôm just confusing her with another Lya.

Wishing you the best Lya! Agree with a lot of the other comments. I liked these videos because her personality is  fun and engaging. Don't force her to be so serious. Good job I'm learning at quarantine status,, Wh y the change? She sounds like a robot. A boring one Who's behind the camera with that gun. ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤• Thanks alot The FrenchPod 101's management team has a problem, they cannot tolerate one teacher is much popular than others,  they forced (or were forced to make) their best teacher to be average. The consequence is that FrenchPod 101 became just like other thousands French lessons on the internet, nothing special.   I feel bad for Lya, I also feel bad for other teachers.   Your guys should find a smart solution, e.g. Lya may host other types of lessons, such as story reading, news talk, let all teachers to exercise their different talent. Good luck! Where is Lya:( These videoes are really helpfull   and     OUI I am now better in french pourquoi? pourquoi?pourpoui? why so serious Lya?
