Now they are trying to wow us with banana foster but it's taking an eternity for them to make it. I just want my bill so I can go the fuck home. I figured I would learn Chinese and also write a successful novel in Chinese while I am waiting for my bill.
*edit: the banana Foster was not really banana Foster, it was just a few scoops of ice cream with some banana slices just hanging around some banana bread. I appreciate the effort, but now I need to really learn Chinese because they haven't brought my bill.
