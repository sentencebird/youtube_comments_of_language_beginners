Now they are trying to wow us with banana foster but it's taking an eternity for them to make it. I just want my bill so I can go the fuck home. I figured I would learn Chinese and also write a successful novel in Chinese while I am waiting for my bill.
*edit: the banana Foster was not really banana Foster, it was just a few scoops of ice cream with some banana slices just hanging around some banana bread. I appreciate the effort, but now I need to really learn Chinese because they haven't brought my bill.
**they finally said they would bring me my bill. I just want to leave this place... I'm not even fluent in english and here am I, learning chinese the last time I take Chinese lesson is when I was in 6th grade lol Why would any one want that to learn that shi#$@ Reasons I wanna learn Chinese:

I used to teach Swahili, but because I am not a dedicated teacher and am doing many things, I have slowed down quite a bit. No videos for the last 2 or 3 years from me!!
So thank you for staying the cause and teaching. 
I like how you use the hand signal for accent marks, it helps me remember even when I am reading by myself.

I love the idea that you have different speakers exemplify a sentence or phrase. Sometimes, students struggle to comprehend other dialogues out of their lessons because they get used to listening to their teacher's voice the whole time. This could fix that problem.

Hi and thanks. im chinese why am i here Thank you I'm here because Cdrama especially Ashes of Love 😝 Joyce, at the end of lesson 30, you say there are more lessons, starting with lesson 31: Where is that list of videos; i looked through the offerings at your channel and cannot see it. Can you put the specific link here: thanks. I really enjoy this series and you as a presenter. Xiexie is good Wô jiào Ophilise I get some difference about laguage if we read from youtube they teach in differently . Then if  we read in class it is not  matched  if it is not matched.then it is useless to read in youtube  can u give some suggeestion from where i should learn exact laguage in youtube or i should join the class Why am I here? 
I am a Japanese learner... This lesson motivated me to learn and travel to Zhung gua What about "arabic language"? 🤔 There are a lot of countries that speak it 😅 What is difference between zhi dao and ren shi ? Where can I learn reading and writing Hanzi ?? These are the best, and the teacher is so helpful in the plan, for the first time in years I am seeing my speed pick up, which motivates me and I can hear more words and phrases, here is a GOOD tip for all here, adjust the SPEED at the lower right hand corner of the movie, go to settings, and then go to PLAYBACK speed, adjust slower to .75....or even slower....you can hear the sounds every bit of them. I'm a British man I live in Shenzhen anyone wanna help me learn Chinese ? (you can see how awful my Chinese is from my video 😂😂😂) Thank you very much for your lesson. It helps me to understand Chinese better.🙏 How can be India called in chinese?

Could  anyone tell me how to learn Chinese in stepwise pattern.. idk why i already know chinese but i am waching how to learn chiese this is so weard And the translation of America is definitely not 'beautiful country'. Mei Guo is just an abbreviation of 美利坚合众国(Mei Li Jian He Zhong Guo). 美利 (Mei Li) doesn't have any meaning at all, not to mention 'beautiful'. In China which language is used likewise ( traditional,or simplified ) I literally don't get it?? I learned Mandarin by watching Chinese dramas with subtitles at a young age.  It's a great way to learn to speak and read the characters. 11:19:21
Shouldn't she have said 'ni hen mang ma?' or 'hen' should be omitted once it's a question? I need to learn Basic Maths first. How long is 170 minutes in Seconds? Can you I will upload your content on a website called Fagacy in its educational videos. I will add links to your video there. Thank you. I am learning Chinese character on Coursera but I have no clue how to use them.Now, I am decided to learn together with this Video.Thank you so much 老师。谢谢你 您 好 你好 What does “pu tong hua” mean then if it doesn’t mean mandarin? Also “dian dian” is different than yi diar, which is what I got taught.. Fascinating. "Ni" is the same in Tamil. Like "Ni yeppudi irukka?" which translates to "How are you?". Similarly "Nin" is part of "Ninga" in Tamil which we use as respect. "Ninga yeppudi irukkinga?" which translates to respectful way of "How are you?"Hello, there!

I hope you are safe. 37:41 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I've encountered a slight error at the 8:00 mark - xingqi means week, doesn't it?
I think the question on screen is actually "Which week is tomorrow?" | I thought one would say ji ri/ji hao if they meant "what day is tomorrow?".

IDK, I'm confused on this one. This is very helpful! Thank you!💖💕Is there an updated version? Great Chinese lecturer This is very helpful, thank you so much!!!!I have been faithfully waiting for this course for a very long time. I checked out all lessons and, like all other courses by Mr Zheng Tao, this one introduces Chinese characters with such clarity, logic and historical interest that it is bound to become the prototype and model for all other instructors to follow.
Although I knew many of the characters presented in Mr Zheng Tao's course, the clarity and interest of his presentations still helped me to solidify my basic knowledge of Chinese characters and to enhance my understanding of them. I am now eagerly awaiting the publication of Level 2 of this course.
Thank you Mr Zheng Tao. You are, indeed, a highly talented teacher. Thankyou. Need more of it.. Why i am here?? Need to learn chinese because of cpop idols😅 Interestingly, prince in chinese 王子(wáng zǐ) sounds very similar to prince in vietnamese "hoàng tử". Maybe because of history with Chinese influence and royalty in Vietnam. It's odd because sometimes even though I don't understand Chinese, the sounds that I hear still let me know a bit of meaning, it's not super common though. What.... In first lesson of Level 1 we are going to die so much homework and studies even our school don't give it to us my head is just spinning..... it's easy ណែពួកអាមិនបានការ  ឆាប់ចេញពីរប្រទេសយើងទៅ     ឬពួកហែងទៅ   បំរើនៅប្រទេសចិនយួនក៍បាន  កម្ពុជាយើងមិនទទួលពួកហែងទេ   ។ Zheng Tao is a master at pedagogy. One of the best Chinese teacher all round!! chineselove I was first introduced to Chinese characters through my studies of Japanese at a university, I learnt a few dozens of characters with their correct stroke sequence but over the years I forgot many as I left the school and did not really continue my Japanese studies.
About a month ago I decided I wanted to learn Chinese, I started with Paul Noble's amazing audiobooks, which I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who's thinking about learning Chinese, but I had very little visual stimuli. Although there is a booklet coming with the courses, it doesn't really teach you to write Chinese characters. So now I can already speak a little bit and know some of the Mandarin Chinese grammar, but I am basically illiterate. So I was looking for a good way to learn the Chinese characters and I stumbled upon this video.
I love how this lesson is structured and the fact that we are shown the proper stroke sequence. And on top of that we learn the proper words for all kinds of strokes together with the historical origins of the characters!
Thank you very much for this video, Mr. Zheng Tao, it's an amazing source of knowledge! 谢谢 Thank you for this video, it is extremely informative. Your explanation is excellent and clear, explaining the etymology of these characters is incredibly helpful for a native English speaker like me who finds the Chinese language difficult to grasp a foundation with. Your video has allowed me to establish a strong foundation in my learning to understand Chinese characters, culture, history and the language itself. 请说明一下，汉字有多少个笔画? Very nice sir👍👍 I wish you would pronounce "jot" correctly.  The "o" is like in lot, or hot. Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰 This the must helpful and informative lesson
 thank you so much This way too complecated. For easy lerning, watch Shoalan's Chineasy video. Way easier than this. 莎拉罗娜！！！ Soaw  it  make  a  diffrence  if  your    left  handed Thank you so much teacher :) シ So, we need to learn all these characters by heart?  Am I right?  How many characters are there? And how do Chinese children learn Mandarin in the first place? I mean when we learn English , we learn  A B C D first and then generally the combination of vowels and consonants makes a word  .... So as in Mandarin , do we need to learn strokes first ? Then ? I am not understanding. What about the characters? Do different characters together make a word? Or a character itself a word? Do different strokes together make a character? Thanks i love your classes~! do you offer one on one instruction? Then why is the number after 3 is so different???? it seems I am not kind of language genius Im here bcoz of meteor garden😂😂
When if i go to china and meet them i can understand what they are saying😅 Спасибо Учитель !!! Это Лучшее объяснение из всех , что я встречала !!! Удачи Вам и Вашей команде !!!!!
谢谢您， 很尊敬您 和我爱中国文和 汉语 ! Thanks you so much teacher for your lessons，I am from Cambodia who watching your videos，And your teaching is perfect，Make me  want to learn Chinese ，It's looks easy to understand，Thanks🙏🙏💪💪 *The funny thing about Chinese script is that, unlike other predominant languages of the world, its old style/form makes more sense and is easier to learn for a non-Chinese person! For example, in the character "shang", the way it was written in the old days to mean "above" made more sense because you had one horizontal stroke ABOVE the other. In modern times, the Chinese characters got messed up and harder to learn, in my humble opinion. That's why, against the recommendations and risks, I decided to learn Chinese by delving deep into its traditional form. I was not disappointed.* I loved your teaching 
If u were a offline teacher I would be more happy 
Thank you so much Thank you I’ve always wanted to learn Chinese and it’s fascinating I want to learn this cuz I want to read manhua... CLEAR & PLEASANT 👍 Keep it up. Best Wishes 🙏 This guy is fucking amazing. Thank you! 我喜欢！ I like it 需是认识中文字。学习部分输入法，要用AI手法，主要你写的字手机的软件，会认识字就好了。让学生知道文字怎样构成。好像学习，口，日，吃，早，唱，喝，，人，大，天，大，头，买卖，这些有关 联顺序,比较容易记住。最好也会一些语音输入法。要跟小孩子讲, 囗 就是中文的 O，月 就是n ，，不需要用笔划来写字。我这意见可能不好。学写我的办法进步很快。写，马，鸟，鹅，下部分一样的字。 I don't know Chinese but I knew king from Jackson Wang's necklace Ok so I'm trying to learn Mandarin, and I'm starting with Pinyin, should I ignore the characters for now or would it help learning them too? BRILLIANT    lesson   on  basic  Chinese characters.
Tqtq ...💝🌻 I'm so confused and my brain is bleeding Very well explained too much helpful My aim to learn chinese is to go china😃😃😃😃😃 a native speaker watch this video just like a Lv.100 player visit beginner's village It is good course , but about 上(shang)，it means position.  It could touch the surface or not touch the surface.  The example you provide  includes the two meanings, I would use body language to explain the two difference.  This course is not good for beginners because it too much unused information. 這一課一般來自一個以漢語為母語的傳統漢語。我對一個土生土長的漢語老師寄予厚望。還有其他以中文為母語的人對這段視頻有意見嗎？ Guys here is her WhatsApp number +447537133937 you can start up a meeting with her for her to loud for you to make a good profit on your investments Its actually satisfying to know that there are other people who have benefited from Cynthia's good will. I have seen numerous positive remark about this broker in the past but this time I am not going to ignore her recommendation, there must be a reason why she is so admired by her clients. How do I enroll with her? Wow she's really doing a fine job managing your portfolio, I've looking for a way to get a professional on my side someone alot like her. So far I have been able to grow my portfolio from $16,240 to over $89,670 within 4months. I just made my first profit of $19,880 from my 20 stocks and I can't wait to make more, been reading about investors that made as much as $250,000 in 8 months and I'd really love to know how and what strategies could me this much profit. I met Mrs Cynthia Smith Emma back in  2019 when she came to Toronto for an entrepreneurship workshop.. she captivated me with her presentation and she has managed my accounts ever since. It's been wonderful working with a woman like her with such expereince, with $14,000 she makes me $38,000 every 4weeks which I choose to reinvest from my profits every time. seeing  how highly recommended Mrs Cynthia came from my boss i had to go along with investing through her platform. I am proud to say that after my wife and i  invested  $65,000 into her platform it didn't take long before we got our profit of  $148,000. Cynthia Edna Mchenry has been in charge of all my stock trading activities for a while now. I got to know about her through my Family therapist, she's been counseling us for some months now and when I presented this topic she adviced I get in touch with Mrs Cynthia. Thanks. I will message her asap. U can get to her though her what's or email. I am new to all of this and would like professional help. Seeing how busy I am with work I may not be able follow up on this whilst paying attention to other things.

Exactly! In order to make profits in the stock market, one has to have a good strategy and proper knowledge of how the holders manipulate the market. Stock management and trade are better handled by experience account managers. My question is how can one invest in stock market effectively with great turnouts? anyone has the full course here??? I'm badly in need for them... Those were easy words to write.  Try the word "biang" for a type of noodles.  Biang is said to be the most difficult word to write in the traditional form because it has 62 strokes. I have a dictation exam for my mandarin class tomorrow so here i am trying to cram it all in one night lmao This is much more informative than some other videos on learning Chinese. I'm glad you give the English explanation also many other courses do not do that. Laoshi you're the best,  you are making it so easier I loved it ! If you don’t write a Chinese character right, and it comes out right, is it not that same Chinese character? 😂 Many thanks...great job done and very well explained 🥰 Easy to learn, thanks teacher! sir..i am from Bangladesh and your video is really helpful to me.....

It makes total sense" Jajaja, I´m not understand well but is really good the curse, and a funny fact:I speak spanish and medium english but is good. For a chinese person he speak good english well. I am assuming he mustve been UK educated. 👏👏👏👏👏👏 Not me learning Chinese for next year Thanks for this video 🙂 when i'm learning hangul it is much easier but in chinese my brain starting to 🤯🤯 my brain is bleeding😭😭 now i know why chinese is the hardest language to learn🥺 Mr. Zheng Tao is one of the best teacher i have ever met online . his way of teaching is very effective especially for beginners like me I always forget all the words characters 😔 After seeing you I remembered my friend I'm here bcs most of the apps in my phone are written in Chinese language and I don't really understand it and I want to understand it somehow lol.

Thank you for making this Litao How to write wang yibo 💚 beautiful.for some reason,i love chinese characters. They are very artistic,carries a great meaning(I saw the old character for speech, and the character ivolved a heart and a mouth,meaning, speech is expressing your thoughts through your mouth). and theyre mystically beautiful. Im basically from the south Indian state of Kerala, and had been interested in Chinese and Japanese culture for its-,i dont know how to express that in words- a sort of mind captivating beauty. Much Love from india. Where I can find your complete course. Dude you are awasome teacher. 01:12 牛上男妈 🤣🤣🤣车压到脸上了 can i have your wechat?

Zai na and nali mean "where". Ni zaina ? means where are you ? Ni shi nali ? also means where are you?. My question is why is it that if i put "shi" in zai nali? like zai shi nali, the meaning changed? While if i removed the shi in ni shi nali , it also changed the meaning. When do i use shi and when do i not? Thank you very much. More power? Nin hao. I would like to ask which is correct to use:

1) wo ting budao ni zai shuo shenme .

2) wo ting budao nide shuo shenme

If budao means can not , buneng also can not , can i use either one?

You're very talented teacher!
Keep doing this great job! 
Wishing you a big success and millions of subscriber! All the best! honest question, just how mandarin speaker can speak so fast with this pinyin? how can they differentiate the sound when talking fast casually? جميل جدا ورائع Omg shes so great. Love to see her do a video on how to teach small kids mandarin Hi Yishuang
I'm an Indian 
And Your lessons are very interesting
I watch your one lesson three times a day I don't think I'd ever get the hang of that 3rd (falling/rising) tone😅 Ma or Mother came from Mata, Pa or Father came from Pita. Whichever language you want to learn you will find similarities with Sanskrit, the mother of all languages. 🙏🙏🙏 I think you are best teacher for teaching Chinese in the whole world 

Thanks😘❤️❤️ Hello super video👌👌👌 thank you teacher I am still learning mandarin please teach me early how to learn mandarin well, thank you thank you teacher I am still learning mandarin please teach me early how to learn mandarin well, thank you All of it same things I feel that this is very difficult 😔
But I hope, that I will learn ☺️
You have taught us well,👌
I will try to understand it fast because Chinese is very difficult to understand
                        Thank you. Hand movements confused me because you did it from your point of view She is so thorough! I'm glas I found her channel! Great teacher cute I am Chinese. I tell you that you don’t need tones to learn Chinese. You can understand Chinese when you speak. Hi am from india I know a bit of Mandarin but I always have trouble pronouncing words with the 3rd tone, I somehow always ended up saying it in the 2nd tone. 哈尔滨普通话，是学哈尔滨话（东北话）吗？ I am jere becuz i wanna make a career outta chinese   help🥲 I can do it Just found this, it was really helpful! Thank you! In sanskrit and pali language of ancient india also maa means mother English counterparts:
1st Tone: aaaaaa (when opening mouth at a doctors appointment)
2nd Tone: What? (Whát)
3rd Tone: Well... (Wěll)
4th Tone: Stop! (Stòp) How you know chinese おやすみなさい ありがとうございます、せんせい Can i teach u 日本語? おねがいします？ Do you know こんいちわ I think it seems a lot harder than it actually is.

1st tone is basically a flat tone, 2nd is rising, 3rd is low and wavering, and 4th is falling and abrubt. And when you say anything it's all relative pitch, so don't worry about over enuciating, it sounds really ridiculous when you over exaggerate the tones. 

The hardest part might be associating meaning to the different tones.

Like when you say "si" with a falling tone, "sì", that means four. But when you say "si" with a low wavering tone that means die.  It can be a hard concept to grasp and i'm not really sure of an example in English, but speaking practice really helps. So good teacher, simply say so sweet, be blessed 😊💕 需是认识中文字。学习部分输入法，要用AI手法，主要你写的字手机的软件，会认识字就好了。让学生知道文字怎样构成。好像学习，口，日，吃，早，唱，喝，，人，大，天，，这些有关 联顺序,比较容易记住。最好也写一些语音输入法。要跟小孩子讲, 囗 就是中文的 O，月 就是n ，，不需要用笔划来写字。我这意见可能不好看。小儿子写学我的办法进步很快。 Perfect 👌 Teacher Great Hi mam how to connect you write now I am working Singapore 👌👌👌👌💐🙏🙏 I love this lady. Very Good teaching methods <3 I can't believe that China had such a great history with such a primitive language. That doesn't add-up I leand it good👍👍 Thank you so much 💓 我一个母语是中文的人听的津津有味。As a native Chinese speaker, I feel it very interesting. I'm very interesting this Chanel I want to know to Chinese language Your teaching system is very good.
Everybody can learn chaines easily. Thanks. She teaches so well but I blushed when she said "very good" it made me want to do even better Very funny to hear the names of parents in Mandarin. Mama means Mother in Dutch and Baba means Dad in Turkish. First minute watching this lesson, don't use MA. This is PERFECT for me as I just started learning Mandarin from Rosetta Stone. You are great. This is a godsend. THANK YOU so much. I definitely subscribed. You're teaching is great. new sub here! Thank you so much! it help me a lot. God bless you Vietnamese subtitles, please You read ba as pa, then how do you read pa? To all the people who are bilingual. First of all i am indian and here we from starting are taught atleast 2 languages i.e. Hindi and English and in south their regional languages. 

So, since we are used to speak both so i never found any edge of Hindi over English and vice versa and both are equal for me and i am equally comfortable in both.

People usually learn other languages in colleges or after graduation. So, it will be difficult for them bcz a child brain grasp things more easily than an adult bcz his mind is empty to learn. People usually start comparing languages and that's why this perception generates that this is harder than that. 

I found it myself difficult to learn korean bcz i start to learn it through English and not korean. Its what i had observed while learning korean.0:22	What is the Chinese alphabet?

For eg. P - फ् (Footage) , K - खअ (Come) , r- र (Rather), q- छी (Chips), x- शी (she) , J - जी (Jeans), h- खुअ (Kuwait), G- गअ (Gum) etc. Etc. I have written in 3 languages English Hindi and Chinese.. I loved to learned in my style as you created is dam good 😘❤️

How many languages have .
Mandarin or colloquial. a lot of these chinese letters look alot like the japanese ones What is the kazama in Chinese oh my gosh, I am literally crying, this helped me soooooo much. I was so confused about learning both but you actually explained what you should learn !!!!!!!! 
and I was able to understand everything, thank you 💙 I’m from Taiwan and clicked this video to see how 拼音 works… But I don,t understand there are so many alphabet in Chinese Nice! What absolute major league BS is this? Clickbait. something is similar to himdi pronounciation how many of you hindi speakers agree Your teaching is so good 👍 😍 都有玩抬头突然擦啦特😀隔天他和突然死啦特啊啪啪 有惨突然啊啦特体会i死聪明闷头🥴 XIEXIE(Thank You)Sooo much because of you i mastered the alphabets... keep making good videos like this I'm a native and I can make sure the teacher is came from Taiwan according to her accent. Namaste 🙏 from 🇮🇳
Thanks  for guide us "mam" about  🇨🇳 Anyone is from India here Wait my Chinese teacher said that b is pronounced as p but with no air As an Indian I am learning Chinese 
Because I can speak Hindi, English which covers very Big part of world Population, 
But just by learning Chinese I can add 1.4 billion people in list. 
That's a huge Number in world.

No matter where I crash Land after learning Chinese.
I can always Find people who speak at least one Language out of these 3 ❤
EDIT : 
Omg I am surprised now-:
It's Crazy how most initial , medials and finalist  Sound in Chinese have a letter dedicated in Hindi alphabets 
Which help in pronunciation and as well as used in writing. 
And by using Hindi Half Letters I can create all Sound in Chinese without relying on any sort of imagination of different words. 
So it's super easy for me to Pronounce Chinese Alphabet sounds 
 unlike English letter which is almost impossible to Arrange in that sound format. hlo you are Chinese 
help me to learn Chinese language 😍 😭😭😢 taking japanese and now chinese , help me, wtf is wrong with me God bless your exploration 😭👍🏼
I finally able to know letters I am learning Chinese...Love China Me who thought to learn Chinese and came straight into the comments section I want to find an teach English for my daughter and I can teach you Chinese

I appreciate your services sir and I also wish to recommend you to everyone here. You're the best ever 💯💯 Same like Assamese alphabet After seeing Chinese character I realized how easy Korean is..

But still keep going Who can  teach me Chinese  language 🇨🇳 please  comment  👇
But  only  girls  🧚‍♀️ The A ,O ,E and U sound exactly the same as in french Who is here after korean 😂 Bruh u are literally talking to me in Chinese bc I didn’t understood anything Bye I'ma go study korean back 🤓 Having taken French & Russian, the Chinese alphabet is similar (to me) to learning Cyrillic. Cyrillic has many diphthongs combined to make one letter rather than separating them out into separate letters. This, to me, is fun! 你好 I had seen "bopomofo" symbols, jyst now they made sense.
Still wondering why Chinese teaching don't use IPA directly. 12:43
Omg it Looks exactly like a Hindi TA like how you pronounce the T in a TOMATO
😂😅 Nice My God too tough At the moment is all Greek to me 😂🤣😂 Very though Why there is Pinyin, Simplified, Traditional and this strange one? You speak too fast so it is difficult to understand for beginners even I'm interested to learn Chinese language.. I'm from Maharashtra n these letters literally sound like Marathi alphabets😂 It sounds similar to our Nepalese alphabet😂😂 What Introduction Vietnamese traditional dress (Ao Dai) is not Chinese 
Okay. Channel Please check 13:05 😃 in hindi there's a character which exactly looks same 😃 it's pronounced as"t" not tiii (preety hard to tell in English letters 😂cause there's many sounds u can think of like that)..... Very soon srilanka's national language will be chinese... What is Chinese alphabet.... We r waiting for more videos. Please don't forget us.. ❤❤❤❤ Wait, that title was not clickbait. I watch so much Chinese dramas and now is lil bit easy to me learn Chinese China is our neighbour country so that's why I'm learning Chinese 
Thanks for the video guys 😇 this reminds me of spanish for some reason - Thanks & Question. 
Can I use these ( alphabets) to write my name or there is another way to write name ? Is it just me that im learning chinese just to go to  china and study and bc my family lives there and im chinese and i dont know that much chinese? I am a Indian and studying chinese language  in lockdown .
But lil hard new sub! My dream job is to join CIA, I'm 15 rn,  so I'm trying to do as much as possible which would get me into CIA including learning 2 foreign languages 😅 Thanks mam I'm Indian 🐴🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Thanks. Is it better to start learning by Pinyin or not? Me learning Chinese....
because of boredom... Thanks😊😊 "ورحمتي وسِعت كل شيء"
ستأتيك رحمة الله
من حيث لا تحتسب
في الأوقات التي تظن
أن النجاة مستحيلة
فتوكل على الله
وفوّض أمرك إليه *In my opinion i think korean's harder... when you say the words cause it will give it like this ... gwoedfg frejds and in chinese it's kinda like spanish for me... like nihao... zaijian jian zai you know how to say it.. but writing chinese is kinda hard* Let's try hard I think this is much harder than english is any in agree with me A b covid La verdad es que no le entendí nada a esta teacher,pero repetiré el Video para ver si algún Día, Anyway thanks I'm a little confuse here. How do I break this sentence 你好 according to the alphabet. It's pronounce Nǐ hǎo. So, 你 nǐ (you). What's the N according to the alphabet? I know ㄋ = N, but I don't see ㄋ in the sentence. Do the letters modify when you put them together? I like Chinese songs too. Sometimes may  sing songs. Through songs I can learned Chinese languages. Bye sister today. Thanks I am learning for someone special. For people knowing to speak marathi (an Indian language) it is easy to learn Chinese. In the German language is also an ü! Süden, dürfen, früh, büßen, Küche, kühn, wünschen, müssen, Glück, flügge, für, Fürst, Rügen, Lügen, fühlen, Wüste, spülen, Küste, dünn, Sünde, Würde, Bühne, Fühler, Führer, Müller, Mücke, dürfen, rüsten, rücken, Küster, schützen, kühl,  etc. No need to learn Chinese virus language 😂🤣 Bo Po Fo Mo? 
波 破 佛 莫. I'm glad I was taught the traditional way -  ZHUYIN. Pronounciation of Chinese alphabet is similar to hindi alphabet...i guess back in the days lot of trading happened between china and india. I am Chinese and effectively bilingual. I have not even heard of Zhuyin before, so I would give it a miss. I don't see why it is even required to learn Chinese. Hanyupinyin helps you with the pronunciation only, so it would be a misnomer to claim that they are Chinese alphabets. This is because if you type out a single hanyupinyin word, no Chinese person would be able to tell which Chinese character you are referring to even if you put in the tones. Even if you were to type out a sentence purely in hanyupinyin, it can lead to misunderstanding. Also, knowing pinyin or zhuyin will not help you understand how a Chinese character is pronounced in the absence of the pinyin or zhuyin shown next to the character - like how English alphabets can sometimes, aid you in the pronunciation of English words.

Therefore, Hanyupinyin is not a building block (or alphabets) of Chinese words, like the alphabets are to the English language.  

Perhaps I am old school, I learnt each Chinese character the old fashion way (i.e. by writing and practicing them) before I learnt hanyupinyin. lol I thought this was one of those western videos that just took a random character and gave it a latin equivalent, completely forgot that zhuyin existed O in Chinese is kinda similar to the Hindi word "tt" its so hard Very bad explanation tempo is sooo fast... Your representation is sooo dumb.. Pinyin is not an alphabet, that alphabet is called the LATIN ALPHABET. And Zhuyin isn't an alphabet at all, but a Syllabary. The "Chinese alphabet" is also not a "phonetic system", it is a graphic transcription thereof, the Zhuyin's "bo po mo fo" are not "letters" they are syllabograms. I am perfectly aware that it sounds like smart-assery here, but since this video tries to educate people on language it shouldn't be so completely uneducated regarding linguistic concepts. most of the comment i saw: watching this vid to learn Chinese so they can understand Chinese dramas (y'all motivated and there's me who cant really care haha)

me: i know Chinese as its my mother tongue, decides to watch this vid for fun- BUT REALISES I WAS NOT TAUGHT ANY OF THIS IN SCHOOL. WAT ._. CHINESE ALPHabet is pinyin.THATS THE MOST EASY TO LEARN AND EASY TO READ. Why should we Onn try cheyth nokka I'm done learning Korean and got improved my French. I'm also learning Japanese and Russian and now planning to learn Chinese. I was raised and born in Philippines who grew up bilingual. Beautifully explained💯💯 The reason is comment  i m more interested in comment section more then video🤣🤣 Any Indian? Ten thousand characters... ! Too confusing.

Thanks from Brazil, I loved! I am really impressed to your acting and teaching.😆😆😆 xie xie ni 人行道 Hi I'm Filipino 嗨，我是菲律宾人 出口 这不难
Means this is not hard. Exellent thanks. Me before the video: HOW does the Chinese language work?
Me after the video: how does the Chinese language WORK? 我是一個香港人呀! just learning how to please my chinese overlords soon 入口 出口 I felt a fuse in my brain just break... European languages were so easy for me and Chinese flips that on it’s head... Yes i enjoy so much...finally i got u 😍😍😍😍now i m improving. This is very helpful. However, it would be great to know how to write the strokes in order. There's so many various Chinese characters that mean so many different things! I'll need a book of every single variation possible to remember them all otherwise I'll be talking complete nonsense to the lovely Chinese people. I'm so afraid of offending them, haha.

Also to me, "Dào" looks like a dinosaur with a very long tail carrying a present. LOL. You are all Great Is this Traditional Chinese?? Because the '見' character is different than 见

And IF THIS IS Traditional Chinese, which should I learn?? Simplified or Traditional, which is better??

Which do you recommend?? It must be a nightmare to write a manuscript in Chinese. I could write a whole paragraph in the time it takes someone to write a sentence in Chinese. The language should have evolved out of this pictograph style a long time ago. I am all for everyone changing to the phonetic alphabet. Terrible,,,,This way is no good! Amazing 👌 kiza no sea lingüista, pero si su metodo sirve para aprender chino, estupendo! 為什麼我一個香港人會看到這隻影片啊？ Maybe it's just me but i prefer learning characters by knowing how they were originally formed and what they initially meant in ancient China, instead of trying to imagine items that resemble the characters. Anyways, great video and thanks for sharing! I enjoy Joy. 出口 ， thank you so much Thanks joy😍😍😍 Thanks it’s awesome😍😍😍 Associating random number sequence with components of a funny bizzare cogent flowing story is how memory mastery champion memorize the card sequence in a deck of card so this is well established memory development technique. This is how humans develop memories all around, nothing too partcular about Mandarin Characters Even English alphabet  is learned by kids through such associations as A for Apple u r an angel mam!! i learned many things from you Hermosa 😍😍😍 very best way of teach us more and more characters.  feichanghao, ganxie ninde Finally, a video that's actually interesting to watch especially when your chinese mom makes you learn Chinese everyday TwT My happy🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🦄🦄 I know, its my 2nd comment here, ive just updated my keyboard to chinese:)

:)) Im so happy that ive found a very good tutorial for beginners! Thank you very much for the great videos. May Allah, the almighty, grant you health, wealth, happiness and every good thing. i was kinda confused when the vid ended but didn't meet the 66 character as said in the title, turns out that it was introduced by episode 😅 poor me 出口 入口 yesss Not the one you said Anyways, Joy,
下次见is correct. I like your smile ‘ Thanks so much Joy from Spain!  I loved your teaching! I'm Spanish pianist living in Barcelona and learning chinese. And very nice rhyming words to end up to a Joy! Is the same that Mandarin?? I keep learning new words from different  great videos, like this one to create my own learning  videos. Currently learning kanji, I think this is tougher Very good and informative! Please also check my videos on Chinese writing. ☺️☺️ I really want to visit shanghai.. I love china and their language, culture 💕 I downloaded Chinesepod! It's super usefull! I got a little bit of chills😂 I have chills! You should make often videos Joy! wasn't able to find other parts. 😥😥😥😥😥 I still got a c I know xia ci 道可道，非常道。 道还是路吗？哈哈哈 Piece of pineapple cake 😆 This is very helpful. However, it would be great to know how to write the strokes in order. I hope you make another series for that. Xie xie! Great please introduce how to write them and the oder 谢谢老 So attractive and effective These are really very useful Chinese words.thanks. Boiiii I know chinese why am I here? great..make more pls WOW I LOVE YOUR VOICE!!!!SO CUTE The snake with the pineapple for 道 is nice!
Thanks! Just started learning chinese this week, these videos are really useful :) Some people say the meaning of chu kou is bad words A HongKonger learn Chinese there. pls. repeat the words for a couple times, need to know those words proper pronunciation I just clicked because I saw a pretty Asian lady. I know Russian, English, German, Serbian. It's enough for staying in my moms basement. wow so good teaching ! but ur cute what is ur fb acc. hehe sorry for asking the scary characters are as follow
肇 zhao4 肇事 the one causing the problem
庸 yong1 平庸 as in boring or insipid
笼 long2 灯笼 latern
螺 luo2 螺旋 spiral; helix
螽 zhong1 螽斯 a long legged grasshopper
懂 dong3 懵懂 dull She is pretty charmy Thanks, Rebecca! I really like that your content is pragmatic! Also the pictures of the signs helps me connect with my other experiences. I'm at HSK3 and nearly at 500 characters. Seeing 行 used as a verb was new to me. But often, I have felt, following the prescribed curriculum may not be the best course for learning everyday Chinese. chu chou also means "export"? 你是四川成都的？ great explanation , love your voice and tone. thank you for the videos snake + pineapple on the back = road She asked me how difficult i found this 20 times Her social media? Kindly provide 2nd episode of this... ep. 1 do not teach 66 words and the next videos do not teach any more videos, sucks!!!!!! Como cuando hablas español y ves un video en inglés para aprender chino I reconize 100 out of 3000 (are the most used character) I feel more confident now than then when I started. If I was learning Chinese (though i'm studying Japanese) i would defo study using your series... it's clean, it's simple and if it was like this I would be so happy.. keep up the great work :D 通过新视频尽快与您的学习见面 好久不见老师🐭 2 pitchforks + mouth = exit

Thankkkk youuuuu I’m a Spanish native speaker, I just picked up Mandarin Chinese, you’re gonna be my first laoshi:) Tai guile! So what's the pronunciation of 'guile' here? It's sounds like G of English letter or K . 
Like  Guile or Kuile? Thank teacher Thank you Ms Kat😊 thank you teacher Hi there! For laoban, could you share what the two tones are? I know both are written with the 3rd tone in pinyin, but for words like nihao that are both written with 3rd tones, ni sounds with the rising tone and hao is said with the 3rd. Does this apply to 'laoban' also? I think I'm hearing 'lao' with the 3rd tone and I think 'ban' with 4th??

I  want to learn basic Chinesse and  Mandarin words to better serve our patients tai Xièxiè le .Nǐ shì yī wèi hǎo lǎoshī..
Katrina, thank u 2 much, really ur lessons are very amazing. Now i'm trying to watch Chinese's dramas and listening to Chinese's songs for more practicing. I'v noticed that there is some progress. Good teaching Mam. I can able to learn mandarin slowly. And also please provide some important sentence in Chinese Mam. Is it harder to learn Mandarin if you know English and Spanish already? I’m a native Spanish speaker but have lived in the US for 20 years so my English is just as good BUT when I look at Mandarin, the structure of it it just confuses me and i don’t know if that’s because I already have two other different structures in my brain? For example, it was an adjustment to go from Spanish to English because the structure is backwards like in English you say “the red car” but in Spanish you say “el carro rojo” which translates to “the car red”. It looks like Mandarin has a whole different structure. I’ve noticed just from listening that it’s kinds backwards too? like if someone’s asking something about tomorrow the sentence starts with the word tomorrow? and then I start to see if it fits a pattern like in Spanish and then I get more confused 😖 I’m really starting to think being fluent in two other languages is getting in my way because my brain tries to find similarities and it just confuses me....that or I’m too dumb to learn Mandarin fluently 😥🙁 I love your video teacher. i think you cute Xiexie laoshi. I enjoyed  your class. This was very helpful. I know a bit but thanks to your video I'm learning those small words to make full phrases. Xiexie ni.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤤🤤 🥰You are a great teacher ! 我爱你 What's the difference between yao and xihuan? Great clarity in your voice hence makes it easier to understand what you are saying.  Keep up the good work 我喜欢你的连衣裙 Ihave a orgasms God Bless, let God lead you sister Got it sister i learn something, hope soon i can use this to learn some chinese Your detailed description on the tones are valuable. I appreciate the you use pace of your voice and hand gestures to help with memorization. For a visual learner like myself this is valuable.  Plus the length of the video is ideal! ස්තූතියි.

       🌹 谢谢你🌹 i learning mandarin now, this video is so helpful. thankyouuu! that was really helpful. xie xie. Awesome vídeos, shame youre not making more :( Wo XI HUAN "DANNI"! How great a teacher. This gal has a real brain inside that lovely Chinese head. If only more people could teach by example and by comparison that way. (How lovely, how pure, how superior to the dummies in the street crowd --- the bug-eyed cows who lean on the poor and needy and crush them, heh-heh --- think "Donald", yuk-yuk). Thanks I'd like to say how impressed I am with your teaching. You are so patient and gentle, and, for beginners Mandarin learners like myself, this is perfect! I will continue to watch your videos. Xiè xiè ni3, Wei Lai! Good..
i am in xining city china..
and i am studying chinese language..
good work..
i like it How come pinyin has got so popular over recent months? You know you have your head phones on too loud when the music at the the end scares you There are many components to speaking Mandarin  . One place I discovered which succeeds in merging these is the Magic mandarin blueprint (google it if you're interested) without a doubt the most incredible remedy i've heard of. Check out all the interesting information . give your email id Dear Laoshi Please upload more videos. Thanks 我喜欢你 對了，我超喜歡妳的口音哈哈～妳是在英國學了英文的嗎？還是。。。 我也不喜歡啤酒呀 I like your voice also English pronunciation ! thank-you. i want to learn to speak Mandarin chinese. Please continue teaching us! wan like Juan wa Xi huan ni wo xi huan! Please invest in a lavaliere microphone ($50 maybe for a decent one) instead of relying on the camera-mounted mic and getting reverby/echoey sound.  Thank you. 啪啪狗 what does this means? please i want  to learn Mandarin chinese as i am working with chinese engineers in my office.
Thanks wo xi Huang podcast wo xi huan xiexie 謝謝 ! ^^ 我喜歡你視頻. (did that make sense? XD) weilai. wo xihuan ni so much :) I feel so hot when you talk Nicely done, and like the way you slow down articulation. Critical for beginners like me! i can teach you chinese ,and you teach me English. wow. i am now fluent after this one video. magical.... yes I learned it. so very smart girl. thank you seee the  next time... maybe I watch your video.. xie xie Wo Xi Huan Ni wo xihuan ni de banfa
xie xie That is so cool that the accents are pitch deciders. Question.., if by chance a word is pronounced incorrectly or uses the wrong tone would it still be possible for someone to understand what is being said based on how the word is being used? For instance.., Wŏ means "I"  & Wō means "nest." If someone were to say  Wō yào (nest want) would the recipient be able to figure out that what I'm really trying to communicate is "I want" ?
I mean.., I would think that common sense is universal to some extent. If I point to something on a menu & say Wō yào I'm sure that they would put it all together. I see a lot of people keep on talking about Rocelangue Method (look on google search engine). But I'm uncertain if it's good. Have you ever tried using this popular learning language program? why you can't write traditions characters and i hope able to see you one day.
teacher Weilai. and i hope able to see you one day.
teacher. Thank you so much that your teaching clearly.
I want to learn more from you and i hopefully not only me say that but other people they will think like what i say too. Thank you - xie xie - awesome! I wondered that whether you are in USA or in China now I could sit and watch you all day  Useless.... Too easy thanks i will follow you thanks for clear explanation,look forward to next tutorial. great job, thanks soo much. Four years later and you're still helping people with this video :) :) Thanks! I could try to learn the whole language this way. Please do more! wo xi huan pi jiu Learning Mandarin-Chinese ain't simple even in basics, yet in  CONVOCONNECT-DOT-COM  only a single click away, you can begin learning dialect you need to study in a easiest way! 

  =) wo xi huan danni s podcast Your so beautiful. Hardly paid attention to ur lesson the first time lol i like when ur speaking chinese tho. But i cant believe u said that. U dont like soccer? Come on.  cute lil voice Where are you? Every day, i spend at least an hour on the net studying Chinese. Learning Chinese through the internet is very helpful and quicker than even attending the Chinese class. very good teacher and very good lessons but being western and studying Chinese myself I would suggest you to point out that when you actually speak Chinese in a conversation and you have two third tones one after the other the pronunciation of the first one of the two will change into a second tone 

like in nĭ hăo actually the "nĭ" becomes a second tone because you never really say two third tones one after the other. I think it's an important thing to point out also when you teach words such as "xi wan" which have this tone situation. 

xie xie  I'm terrible at accent marks  NI XIHUAN SHENME?  not SHENMA  it's like chinese people made their language hard on purpose :3 Aw, wo shi huan ni de accent! ;) Thanks for the clip! Hello. I Fahd of Saudi Arabia teaching you taught me English and Arabic on Skype f12a1 wo xi huan? is that okay? i wanna make love to you The 欢 [ huan ] in 喜欢 [ xi3 huan5 ], "to like", is generally no tone. It is first tone in words like "welcome", 欢迎 [ huan1 ying2 ], so I find Chinese people often write it as the first tone. Laoshi, wo jiao Matthew. wo xi huan ni videos. PLEASE POST MORE Xie xie. Wo ye shuo zhongguoren. Wo xihuan ni de dian ying. Zhe ge hen ku. I'm still learning more Chinese. Please keep making more vids. :-) Xie xie. Wo ye shuo zhongguoren. Wo xihuan ni de dian ying.

Welsh people: “I’m listening...” 漢子學習很容易  大陸人路過 Is it bad if I don't learn any simplified Chinese? I've been learning Japanese so I only know the traditional ones. In the future the only alphabet used will be a %100 consistent phonetic alphabet........ I guess it's time to wake up. i find the chinese language so interesting and abstract. i want to learn more about it and challenge myself to recognize characters I live in hk I had trouble reading Chinese and a hard Tim learning but because of this i think I'm getting the hang of it ^_^ Sometimes I'm  gone crazy read translate version novel 200 chapters per day if only i can read it in original on site so that i will never late on updated chapter on Chinese novel until now its still look scrabbling Actually i tried korean as well i learn the alphabet but there is not any viedos and teacher like you who make really learn ......😀i found that chinese is more easier

Screw it, I'll give both a shot. Sorry, but "beautiful" obviously means just a big sheep. And big is indeed a person spreading their hands: 大
person: 人
I don't see the logic in 'beautiful' be comprised of 'sheep' over 'big'. that skin complexion though...

I speak and a little Chinese and I can write a little Chinese and I am Danish Is it possible to read chinese without learning character pronunciation or pinyin? I'm Chinese, I have to say this might be the best Chinese course on youtube!
There are tooooooo many vedio course, lots of them only make people feel frightened about Chinese, even native speaker like me can't understand what they mean :(
I'm learning Russian right now (want to speak to my Russian idol in the future! Zhenya Plushenko❤)
But large amount of vedio course make me nervous, and not sure which one I should follw...That reminded me maybe some beginners like me, is puzzle in Chinese too! 
So this is my reason. ( The following Chinese is for Yangyang, it's NOT the translate of preceding article, I don't want to misleading you xdddddd
本来只是在找俄语课程，偶然看到这里，看了一点儿后发现对自己母语有了更深的理解！谢谢你030~谁知道小时候上课我在干嘛，也许在睡觉……
标题内容文字就连你的妆容都很棒！
不过，中文用幼圆字体，会不会误导他们？点横竖撇捺没有笔锋，外国人可能更以为中文是画画？
初学者可能跟着学写字，即使他们不知道什么意思，选一个字形正确的字体，可能更好？
个人意见，无意冒犯~希望陈老师这样棒的视频能被更多人知道！ it still scary  -_- thanks you made it seam so easy and fun. Ni hao 
I m from Pakistan 
I m learning Chinese nowadays 
I have done 8 classes n like your videos n follow it  its very helpful 
Good jobi dont like that eng translation is pronounced , i'd choose smt only chinese Xié xié I dont understand what native people say, they speak too fast, i can understand what singaporeans says tho ראיתי סרט על האבולוציה של האותיות עברית ולטינית או להפך וכו אך מה ההבולוציה של הצייניסתית No need music plz The music is like the music that they play in goodwill; it feels like it is the end of the world and we are recording the languages that existed in our time 谢谢你 Is this mandarin Them:i want to learn korean
Me:i want to learn chinese This is perfect for how my brain retains information.  I can listen, repeat and learn to read and write by comparing English words to the Chinese words (modern Chinese works easiest for me as it uses English alphabet with the tones noted so I can know how to pronounce) .
Best video I've found so far for learning as I am teaching myself.

Alarm: hard noise" 🇧🇷👍 parabéns Congratulations GOD bless you my professor And family 🇧🇷👍 gratifying 🇧🇷👍 🇧🇷👍 parabéns Congratulations 🇧🇷👍 gratifying thanks you my friend 🇧🇷👍 let's pretend i sleep 10 hours @Useful Chinese with Chris • Very well made. Nice. 
BUT, none of all the sentences about health  problems, not being able to sleep,  lack, worries, belong in a video that one is listening to while going to sleep! All those sentences should be in videos teaching how to express oneself, and understand, on these topics, such as medical, at the doctor, and dealing with problems and emergencies. 
Apart from that, very much appreciated. Pleasant voices! And the music is relaxing. Thank You. 谢谢你。 What this does is program your subconscious mind. So when awake, the words won't sound so foreign. I am 16 and I'm learning mandarin. This video is so helpful and beside that watching Chinese dramas or something like that it's can be so helpful while learning because you get to know new words and what does it means or listen to music, Chinese music of course it can become important in your learning as will. I'm having a hard time learning mandarin really. I am Bangladeshi.  But.I love Chinese Why hide the pynin pronunciation? How to take classes I Know Every Word I'm stay here at taiwan for 5 years until now I can't speak Mandarin very well .

Thank you,:) Dear Fahama sb, thank you. Today was my first class. Brilliant https://youtu.be/QLzjJTYeP64 Great Abc of chinies sy start krna chy Keep it up Ni hao kia mein is k lecture whatsapp py ly skti hoo Ap plz a to z ta chaina m dikhaye 簡化字在所有漢字中只佔很小的比例。簡化字切斷了與未被簡化而又同源同脈的漢字之間的關聯。簡化字用偽造的偏旁部首代替真正的偏旁部首。簡化字大多都是最常使用的漢字。現在的常用字不代表過去和未來的常用字。簡化字妨礙學習者識認大部分的未被簡化的漢字。簡化字給中文的學習和應用造成很大的麻煩。

Simplified characters account for only a small proportion of all Chinese characters.  Simplified characters cut the connection with the Chinese characters that have not been simplified but have the same origin.  Simplified Chinese characters use fake radicals instead of real radicals.  Most of the simplified characters are the most commonly used Chinese characters. The current common words do not represent the common words in the past and the future. Simplified characters prevent learners from recognizing most of the unsimplified Chinese characters.  Simplified characters cause great troubles to Chinese learning and application.

簡略化された文字は、すべての中国語文字のごく一部を占めています。 簡略化された文字は、簡略化されていないが同じ起源を持つ中国語の文字との接続を切断します。 簡略化された中国語の文字は、実際の部首の代わりに偽の部首を使用します。 簡略化された文字のほとんどは、最も一般的に使用される中国語の文字です。 現在の一般的な言葉は、過去と未来の一般的な言葉を表すものではありません。 簡略化された文字は、学習者が簡略化されていない中国語の文字のほとんどを認識できないようにします。 簡略化された文字は、中国の学習と応用に大きな問題を引き起こします。

建議學習繁體中文。
It is recommended to learn Traditional Chinese.
伝統的な中国語を学ぶことをお勧めします。 ميں اپنے چینل پر چینی زبان پڑھاتی ہوں Ye Chinese likte kis Tara he matlab in Ki writing 🙄 Assalomo alaikum janaab

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGkuvwcMiIQy1If2BiDpQ8w Ni hao This is very easy way of teaching but I have a question qing wen ki pronounciation smjh nai a rhi hai Very good effort!! Really appreciate that one of our own is making learning Chinese very easy. At first, I tried learning Chinese from English, but it didn't work for me and I lost the will. In the first try,  i starting learning Chinese characters which was very difficult, but this time my approach is different and my source of learning is in my local language. I hope i will succeed this time. Inshaallah!! Thank you very much for this course!!!Follow along with Teacher Becky and then sign up for a Free Trial Lesson of your own with one of our teachers in China.

Keep in touch! 谢谢 So, you can use both xiānsheng and xiăo when you are talking to a man? Thanks for this I love this video ♥️♥️ If 'ni zao' means good morning then why did luolan wrote 'nimen' as goodmorning??  and I saw somewhere it was written ' zao an' as good morning and 'ziaoshang hao' as good morning, see im losing confidence that if you are teaching us correct, ok just say once that everything you teach us is 100% correct please😥😥😥 ( don't take me wrong) Thank u teacher it's all very clear, logic and structured. In a word systematic. Just the way languages are supposed to be taught; I am glad that Chinese has not been fooled by the utterly, crappy communicative bullshit the English language teaching business forces onto teachers. Just one question, how come he and she are the same? How are you supposed to distinguish between them. I made it this far. I am quite proud of myself. Why are you interested in learning Mandarin Chinese? Share your motivation with us here in the comments! Why do you say 小王and not 王先生? Also, why 你早 and not 早安? How do I access the longer version of this video? Thank you Is this simplified or traditional? Xie Xie  xiaojie Bekky 😊 for wonderful teachings , learning with ease . thank you so much to share something great like this. it is really hard to understand and how to speak but it is oke thank you for teaching chinese......................
it's amazing one.....i love china... Nizao Becky. I thought "xiao" (小) meant small. But does it also mean "Mr" or is it just something you Chinese say? Roland is the name of a male How come here you can say Xiao Wang but in previous lessons it would be Wang Xiansheng? Best and Offline Chinese Dictionary for your Android Phone

By the way, now you can learn pinyin on the website:[3w.dongyu.com/chinese-video-courses/chinese-pinyin]. It should be more convenient for you. :D 那下次回北京的时候一定得拜你为师好好纠正一下我这普通话发音。你可不要谦虚哟！ Hi, Our office is in Beijing, China. But students abroad learn Chinese with us via skype or online videos. :D 肖敏娜老师：不用谢！你这个中文辅导节目是在中国国内呢还是在海外呀？ Hi, thanks. xiexie. Minna, u r very pretty, too. Good job! Xiexie, we will do better with your support. Please help to share it with your friends so that more friends will join us. Thank you.

Bu ke qi. ^^ This is perfect!!! 谢谢，我很喜欢这！！！ No problem. thanks so much
 "zao shang hao" and "zao" are very commonly used among Chinese people. “Ni zao” is also used in China, not only in Beijing, but it's not as popular as the first two. Yes, I think I was confused too. I always say "Zao shang hao". I've never heard anyone say "ni zao", and I've lived in China for 17 months. Is that Beijinghua? You can take a look at this wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=WTe4_cC4Zxc xie xie! ususally, we don't say "zao chen hao."  We say "Zao! (早)" or "(Zao shang hao!)早上好！" to greet friends in the morning.  wait wait a sec, I thought good morning was "zao chen hao"...is this wrong? is there a lesson 2? Hi, Ni hao. Can i help you? @petigs01 Wow, you are such a diligent student. Jiayou. @adfwtawtsgf These are Chinese surnames. So what's your surname? @Mellow790 Ni hao. My friend from 马来西亚。I'm always here if you need any help. im taking notes :p @jamilj921 There are always some differences between languages.
In Chinese, different Chinese characters have different meanings though they share the same pinyin. In English, there are also words which sound the same but mean different things.I guess these are something we have to face and learn.
 difficult ,,ta he and ta she
frienad you type ,,pengyou ,,,if we type ,,pangyaw,, what do you say about this
 @taibangle1 Haha. 情人节快乐！I bet you have had a great time. Yes, we keep updating new videos every day and thank you for your support. :P Xia4 wu3 hao3 MinnaXiao Laoshi !  hope you see the sun shining today :} in Beijing 
It is Monday here still and today the retail stores will sell lots of candy and fowers
because...it's " Qing2ren2jie2 !!!!!  I hope all  your friends and you recieved many
boxes of candies from your nan2peng2you3....
I will look for the updates through the week... It's true Wo ye hen gaoxing. 
I spend the last three days working back stage on a very special chinese show. I know my level is  very low, was fun @taibangle1 Oh, Ha. We are updating and posting videos every day except holiays or weekends. Wo ye hen gaoxing. @MinnaXiao I just realized Feb 2012 is one year you have been posting/uploading videos !!!!! Gan4 de hao3  ! gong1 xi3 !!!!!
 @taibangle1 Happy to know that our videos have helped you.
Yes. Ni zao is a another way to say “Zao shang hao” and is more informal.
So you can say “Ni zao” when you meet your friends or colleagues in the morning.
 @Dazaifu It's a great way to learn Chinese. As long as you keep going on, your Chinese will improve a lot. Good luck. @MinnaXiao I always used zao3 shang4 hao3 for good morning, now I see new vocabulary!
I can also use Ni1 zao3 too. Both ways are fine?
I like watching these again over and over there is so much I missed. Now my understanding of what they are saying is improving...Your methods work well !   @Chinese2PlainEnglish Hi~ You are welcome. keep in touch! It's so easy to understand Chiinese language just I need to parctice so hard everyday to get the new words and to think in chinese automaticaly @TheManiNicole Hi. Do you mean “你早！(Nǐ zǎo)” “你们早！(Nǐmen zǎo)”?
Though they both mean “Good morning!” they are used differently.
When you greet one friend, you should use “你早！(Nǐ zǎo).” But when there several people (more than one people), “你们早！(Nǐmen zǎo)” should be used.
 @andreasjigo Wow. Thank you for your help.  I hope you also like our videos. By the way, we uploaded the latest videos under the account of “eChineseOnline.” Hope you will enjoy them. @MrAntaga Can you write in English? Sorry, I can't understand. :)  videonya bagus mbak,.. mbak gurunya cuga cccuuuuuuantek,.... aku naksir deh,....
 @knowyourboundary123 
Yes, there are some different words to indicate such as go, gone, going. I would love two explain through examples: 

我和朋友去中国。(Wǒ hé pénɡyou qù zhōnɡɡuó.) I go with my friend to China.

我和朋友已经去中国了。(Wǒ hé pénɡyou yǐjīnɡ qù zhōnɡɡuó le. ) I've gone with my friend to China. “了 (le)” used to indicates a perfect tense

我要和朋友去中国。(Wǒ yào hé pénɡyou qù zhōnɡɡuó. ) I'll go with my friend to China.
“要 (yào)” mean “will,” it indicates “I will go to China.” 
 @joymelody15 Thanks so much. :) We will try our best to do better.  this is great!!
 si por favor siga posieando mas videos, son muy entendibles y muy utiles,gracias
soy mexicano del estado de veracruz, pero vivo en Reforma chiapas, 
 @eshro: Ni hao. I'm Minna, a Chinese teacher from China. I will continue posting more videos. :)  Hope you enjoy watching them. By the way, please feel free to contact me if you got any Chinese related questions.  ni hao goodnight can you put more video's so i can learn more chinese words thank you very muchQUIZ APP for iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/learn-chinese-with-yi-zhao/id1361903983?l=au&ls=1&mt=8
This Quiz App can not only help you to check your knowledge you have learned from my videos, but can also help you to practice recognizing Chinese characters. The quizzes do not have Pinyin to rely on, but if you choose a wrong answer, a correct answer with Pinyin will pop up. I think you might be surprised by how many Chinese characters you can actually recognize. I hope you have a lot of fun playing the Quiz App. :) Excellent! Just found your channel! Will recommend it to others and I hope to get a chance to practice with regular folks when I return to China! (Most of the people I met in China wanted to practice their English rather than speak Mandarin!) 谢谢老师 Thanks Thank you so much 😍😍

yep anything for kpop....... Wait there arent any alphabets??? 👌👌 If you'd like to learn Mandarin, you are warmly invited to visit my channel. With the CLUSTER 🍇 method, you'll find it much more easier to swallow the vocabulary. I also give lots of engaging tests so  the game is much more fun. English caption is available, just for you 😘💛
https://youtu.be/LH6KFYwYj7w If we give pen to 3years old kid, he would write better Chinese than adults :-| nice😊 Where did you get that pen It writes good👍 Lol! I wonder how for a native japanese of course it may be tremendously "difficult" to write modern chinese characters! 
😅 很不错，但是有点儿不习惯。 你好吗？ Amazing , you really should do More videos about chinese writting ir han yu. As always , congrats and thanx a lot your handwriting is so neat and pretty! When I write Chinese it’s soo ugly Beautiful strokes!!!! 好啊！ Pronunciations please كلكم صنين When I could read all the characters I thought ."Yes !

Ni hàu Wow......I can watch this the whole day. It's so Beautiful 😍 正體字の方が正しいですよ。簡化字を使うと共産主義の宣伝になりかねません。 你好，我是氹仔的人。

Hi, I’m Taipa person 二報う 안녕하세요
I am going to upload a video today I make vlogs of how I learne korean language i'm in love with the pen... the strokes are addictive在乎自己在乎的人和他人一样东西是什么样子呢……我的人生是什么样子都！ 1800th like👍 I’m Chinese and I dunno why I’m watching this lol 😂大家加油啦！💪🏼 我已经学习中文一年了。 我觉得这些听力问题并不难。 虽然几个课题用HSK 5-6的词语，但是你不所需知道它们。看看图片，猜猜它们的意思就可以。 quá hay quá tuyệt luôn video hay tuyệt luôn Estoy aprendiendo inglés y chino al mismo tiempo jaja. 
Wo zhengzai tongshi  xuexi yingyu he hanyu , hahaha
我正在同时学习英语和汉语，哈哈哈。
I learning english and chinese at the same time, Hahah . Hi there are you guys going out for the meeting tomorrow at five or at least five minutes late I will be home in about five minutes So was the day you were going to be home and I will be home in about an hour Not now Gabriela I’m trying to think I finished listening to it and I will continue to listen to more until I can understand them which is about a year away of intense studying. Me, HSK -2 acting as if I understand any word in this video 😃 I’m Taiwanese
 when I listening EG just like you listen CH😂 I wish this wasn't the only thing I could find when I search for Chinese listening practice because these videos are incredibly generic as they have so many other languages that for alltheir videos they just  take the same video and plug and chug despite the cultural differences or nuance, so it's not the best thing if you want to practice listening comprehension for real spoken Chinese...... but it's free at least :/ Para mi no es dialogo de principiantes. Al menos hsk 2/3.. o estoy equivocado? Stopped watching after exactly 52secs! For beginners lol yea :/ too hard fo me( Out of all the races I could be born into. WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE CHINESE! such a waste Its been a full year and I’ve come back to this video from my early days with Mandarin and I can say that I can understand some of the dialogues depending on what topics come up. Great to see progress! This is definitely not for beginners, this is somewhere in the lower intermediate or higher beginner stage with some higher intermediate words thrown in. 加油 看着外国人学汉语，呵呵呵 身為普通話為母語的我，都覺得好難。 For hsk 4 beginners 我觉得这俩人口齿不清，而且有口音，不算是普通话 Im in Chinese III and I have to focus so hard to understand at all every five seconds I would pause the video and think "ok, now what did she say again?" Ni yao mai shen me? Then i got lost after all that XD Beginners haha
Ni hao! Xie xie。谢谢你。你好。 you call this beginner.lol, need to find another channel 制作一些视频关于汉语水平考试 I learn chinese language because my husband I got uh... one word. Wo 'uesi hanyu for liang yue jin self-study  and ni de website wo xihuan hen duo. keshi wo jue de zhe ge video bu shi beginners video yinwei wo mingbai hen little. It would have been almost perfect if you had the pinyin in the answers as well I dont know why I am seeing that 我觉得这个难度对外国人来说的确有点高 I'm practicing ielts listening. I just wanna find something fun to encourage myself keep practicing ! BTW I'm a Chinese. I don't think it's really for beginner. I've just finished hsk3 but i still have some problems with this level HELP
 Who is interested in some language exchange? I speak French, Spanish and English, and I'm looking for someone to practice my Chinese with. 
Hit me up brothers and sisters I'd be happy to meet you ! So easy The woman is too tired , she probably needs to get some sleep instead of pretending to make a "for beginners" podcast 4:19 要幾盒牛腩? I FIND THIS IS A RECURRING THEME. THE CHINESE JUST DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 'BEGINNERS' MEANS. It's kinda harder than beginner level I believe but at least the native speakers made this video. Just search "English listening test in China"... 挺无聊，和中国的英语考试一样，不过起码是母语者在说，中国的连tm母语者都不是 For those who don't think this is for beginners,  it is in perspective of the Integrated Chinese book set.  This is about everything you learn in Integrated Chinese 1 , parts 1 AND part 2. So don't get discouraged,  just keep practicing.  You'll be suprised how much you can say,  and understand,  at the beginner level!
I also browsed through and say that they have an absolute beginners listening as well. 
Happy studying! 真的是很无聊了。。和我学英文一样。。 I'm I. HSK2 and I can't barely understand this These dialogues are really simple.





Probably Because I'm a Chinese. This is much more for “beginners.” Check out the YoYo Chinese on the street series...  https://youtu.be/VIzu-6wFaKE not exactly Chinese 101 is it? This is not for beginners, you get my dislike! this is definitely not for beginners but as I have been learning Chinese for some time already, this practice has been very useful for me How can be this for beginners??😥😥 Ty what happened?打印机在哪 Wth bigeners you ass! 21:05 - 23:03 people look scandinavian/nordic and not chinese. 很好！ 我可以理解他们说的大部分内容 ！ 谢谢 hello  I follow your channel constantly all the lessons I liked I do not have a credit card to buy any book and thank you for understanding. I want a book to learn this beautiful language. I have long been fascinated but I have not found anyone yet. Help me send me a book with a gift. I will not forget it. Longevity I know for certain that the book is not useful anywhere.  MY  ADDRESS YOUSSEF NIACH:  HAY EL JORF LAKHDAR RUE  26 N 12 OUJDA 60032  MOROCCO its not for beginners! i had a hard time just following what is being said. I am quite struggling to understand this As a Chinese man, I feels like this is little too hard for beginners Wow! This video was awesome 这简直跟英语听力一样，讲了半天，结果答案就是开头那就话 Tip: Click the 'settings' icon at the bottom right of the video, select the 'Speed' option, and slow it down however much you choose ~_n Ta de ta ta da ta da dianhua 😂😂😂 很輕的電腦 ?????? 邏輯怪怪的 一般人會講輕薄或者是輕型 怎麼會有人講很輕的電腦????? 視頻有錯 I am past basic level and find this a bit difficult im reading these comment and wondering if anyone here has chinese parents or are of chinese race because i am ABC and this is very easy.. Helpful exercises and practical situations!

 Natural speaking style means it's NOT for absolute beginners. But there's plenty out there for you guys anyway! This is definitely not for a beginner. 
However, if you listen to it over and over again you will get it. I've learned that the hard way with anything you want to do. Do it over and over again and you will master it! 加油! The dialogue at 8:46 is good, there are 2 native (!) Chinese speakers, and the male speaks slowly and clearly when giving directions. And this is not for the beginners. Change the woman, pls. Her voice is not good. I think this is really helpful, and mostly doable for HSK3-ish level learners, but I agree there's vocab that's unreasonable for beginners. 
For example, 美满 is HSK6 level, and the sentence "真是一个美满的家庭“ (22:57) could have very easily substituted an easier word. So why include a word like 美满？ I think, this listening test is much harder than the beginners stage. I speak Chinese as my native language, but I still did some mistake during this listening video. definitely not for beginners. "printer", "powdered capsule", "aisle seat"... I mean come on That first woman has the most obnoxious voice I\ve ever heard. Couldn't fucking listen for more than 10 seconds. DISCOURAGING SPEED. OBVIOUSLY NONE OF YOU IS A TEACHER. These listening comprehension lessons are an awesome resource! Thanks! I think a lot of people are naturally confused when they come across this video labelled as "Beginner" but don't know that ChineseClass101.com has different levels for "Beginner" and "Absolute beginner". Although it has to be said the "Absolute beginner" Dialogues are also pretty much impossible for an absolute beginner! Beginners? I didn't understand anything they said. 口语 很 难 懂。 糟糕! I would consider this mostly intermediate level with some advanced vocabulary thrown in there. Beginners? 第二个测试 第一题 不知道公交车站在哪里的人 可能也不会知道公交车在哪里停 所以这是伪命题 Whatsapp Group for Chinese language students. Write using Chinese characters or speak out loud using the Chinese language. It's not allowed to use any language besides Mandarin Chinese.

https://chat.whatsapp.com/FyVKMPY0S4jK1eo1HSPyrn they consider this for beginners? more like advanced I am having hard time following since they are talking to fast and can only pick out a word here and there. 4:51 what a tongue twister This woman's eye make-up looks awful. Don't put your make-up like this, dear Chinese for beginners and the subtitles in Chinese characters as opposed to pinyin.  How stupid is that!! I have a Japanese and Chinese listening test tomorrow. I just finished the Japanese one and clicked this one because i thought it would help... its the same questions and answers. Two things that I find confusing:
1) Very loose translations, e.g. nin xiang mai shen me? was translated as "May I help you?" which in fact means "What would you like to buy" -> I think such loose translation may cause beginners to get really confused
2) non-standard Mandarin pronunciation, e.g. zhi dao (to know), the lady pronounces (at least what I can hear) as chi dao - now I am aware of it, but does the woman really use the genuine spoken Chinese or maybe she has got some speech impediments? At first I was very confused. Thanks for the upload. Though it is a bit challenging, it help me a lot in improving my Chinese This is not for beginners I doubt it haha good luck everybody I started learning 4 months ago and i still think i am a beginner, but i think these videos are perfect for beginner I can understand 95% of them. I don't know why other comments are ridiculous but trust me you should practice from these videos. your listening will really improve. Definitely not for beginners, but excellent listening practice for intermediate level. 非常感谢你们! Thank you!  This is extremely helpful listening practice. Not for beginners. This is probably the best website/channel to learn real Chinese. I was stuck with nihao for several months until I found this channel. for "beginners" lol yea right I am having HSK 5 with 88% in my listening but I am quite struggling to understand this, I mean it contains words like 精致 for example. Just wondering because the title says its "Beginners".... The sound is like we hear in normal, real conversations instead of as a lesson performance. I like it! Pinyin would help.  I feel so discouraged by these beginner listening exercises.  I  get them all wrong, because I know just enough Chinese to be tricked by the curves they throw. I'd be better off randomly guessing.【Culture Talks】                              https://is.gd/6EtYKj

I have a school vacation task today 
to introduce myself in any international language. 1 minute video. I selected Chinese. Your video has helped me a lot.  Anyway thankyou...😊😊 *Xie xie* for the vdo.. 
😁.. I can say thnx in Chinese for now.. And some greetings.. but I wish I will learn your lesson rapidly..
*Zai zian* 👋 Wwwao!!!! Great! Thank you very much for this magnificent class. It really helps me a lot. Keep on teaching me more please :D 😊😬 Teach me :? 大家好。我叫 Pradeep。我的朋友们都叫我 Pat。我来自加拿大 What if I want to say "You can call me __ or __"? I have two nicknames Am learn Chinese from Africa , country Zambia I need any partner for chinese speaking... We don’t really say let me introduce myself  in Taiwan. You don’t say that to friends. It sounds so formal. 
Btw, We would say 自介 instead of 自我介紹 my  chinese  is  not  good This is the first video introduction to Mandarin that convinced that I could learn it after a few years of practice. 
All other introductions  I saw before  discouraged me after a minute, their introduction made Chinese seemed too hard for me to learn. I was seriously thinking that I could never learn to pronounce it.
I must praise you for very detailed explanations, great instructions (with clear instructions on screen)   and most importantly very clear pronunciation by multiple native speakers.  Usually, Mandarin sounds incomprehensible to us European because it is a tonal language and pronunciation is something completely different than anything we are used to.  However,  this video is very detailed and I've already learned a lot from it. Thank you. I have been learning Chinese for a year now. But I wasn't confident to introduce myself to other Chinese speakers. This template has helped me a lot. Thank you for sharing it :) 从现在开始你是我的中文老师 Good work Wow! Very easy to follow and learn ! 😊❤👍 What is the my  Chinese name yaashini ☺ This is a very good and useful video to learn Chinese not like other videos where they translate a few Chinese sentences and expect you to memorize. 
I am Chinese but can't speak Chinese Fluently; my pronunciation and grammar are not good. Since I haven't spoken this language for a very long time, my Chinese vocabulary is also poor.
I used to speak Chinese with my Grand parents in my childhood; after their demise, nobody in our family spoke Chinese. Omg it's so difficul 😵  but I want to learn Chinese for cdramas😶 From India 🇮🇳😅 大家好，

and the pinyin zhuo is wrong. it should be 'shuo'

at 11:51 it should be 'xian' instead of 'qian' xie xie Ni Chinese cause im a Chinese There are many components to learning Mandarin easily . A resource I found that successfully combines these is the Magic Mandarin Blueprint (check it out on google) definately the best remedy that I have ever heard of. Check out the incredible info .

いいえ、結構です Ni hao, I heard sometimes say "hen gao xing ren shi ni" please tell me why that change the order? is't depending on situation? xie xie. jieshao yixia? what does this mean we could we find the next episode, due to we didn't finish it yet, and we can't find next one continuously i have a doubt..in earlier video u said xing means surname..and in the sentence "nice to meet u" u r using the same word  "gao xing"..confused!!! Susantha hewahata too many new words,still i think i got most of it,Thanks! nice teacher Thank you for your lessons! Hope you can upload more video lessons :) ni=vos

Actually, this is a  formal sentence. you can just say " ni  hao"(means hello) for short in an informal situation. Ni hao! Thank you very much for these great videos! I am part Chinese and have always wanted to learn the language, so these videos are great, especially for pronunciation! I just wanted to ask you if there are multiple ways to say "nice to meet you"? Thank you so much! Hi Minna. British teacher continues for 3 months. Then Chinese teacher continues for next 3 months. I attended first 3 months and then I had to leave, to London. However I still continued my own effort to learn on you tube and google. I'm very lucky to find your channel. Next month I change my job. Then I have exams. Then I plan to join eChineseOnLine & learn more. Best wishes. Imran. Thanks Minna. I have seen e-chinese-on-line website today. I think I should join. I live in UK.

- means stay at the same note
\ means "slide down"
/ means "slide up"
V means "Start high, go low, go high" 

If you watch the video with this in mind, you will pick up inflection VERY quickly... it's just pronunciation, then. 我是巴西人。

https://youtu.be/i0Zgjs4mCa0 Xiexie laoshi hen you yisi 我非常喜欢这视频 a very interesting lesson today. thank you. Thank you so much! Keep the great work Thank you for this great learning resource! 
I'm surprised how many "letters" aren't pronounced in spoken Chinese. E.g. in 16:19 I heard "Sa yue, er sher ha" Ni man hao I like Chinese language on 30:44 it says 吃了再走吧。 I didn't understand the usage of 再。 It doesn't mean "again" Can you explain with more examples ? This is the best I have ever seen. Thank you Thank you for this great effort ❤
谢谢老师 wonderful work and really helpfull, thank you ! Thank u so much, I answered 90% correctly, looking forward to the decreasing of dollar currency so that I can enroll the full course. it's worth a lot!! thanks a lot laoshi good teaching 很不错，我学了很多，从尼日利亚 This is so helpful for listening practice and I’ve also started using it for dictation. 😁🙏🏾 It would be wonderful if not this horrible sound in the meantime... 谢谢老师！ 谢谢在越南 Can you please explain the pattern of the marks allotted per question in a part? Please guide me NOT ONLY IS THE SPOKEN ENGLISH TRANSLATION UNNECESSARY, IT ISN'T GOOD ENGLISH.
I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR BEING DIRECT. 
THIS IS A PRODUCT INTENDED FOR MASS CONSUMPTION.
IT SHOULD BE OF A HIGH QUALITY.
I WOULD EXPECT TO BE JUDGED SIMILARLY. WHY IS THERE A SPOKEN ENGLISH TRANSLATION?
WE'RE LEARNING CHINESE NOT ENGLISH.
UNNECESSARY AND A HINDRANCE. This isn’t easy and it’s only HSK 2 😳 At 1:53, I do not understand why kuài is used with shŏubiăo.  A piece of watch? I’m going through the levels,  did well on HSK level 1 video you made, (thank you for that! So freakin helpful 💕) so now if I don’t do well on this, I can work towards doing almost perfectly as my goal!

Edit: I’ve done better than expected so far, but I’m realising I need to study some things such as common objects and a few verbs. But I’ll continue just to see if I can manage... hope I can 😂 谢谢你们! 我真爱你们的练习! 对我来说太难了
Duì wǒ lái shuō tài nánle This video/lesson shows how language should be taught. I could not understand half of the sentences and I have passed HSK 2. Communication is much more than learning words and grammar. Maybe Chinese (as well as other languages) is taught the wrong way. Maybe we should learn words, grammar and syntax from listening initially without visual input, not from books. Could this be why many students learn a language and then realize that they cannot speak to or understand locals when they visit the country? Thank you  for your hard work. Thanks , This is very helpful, i can practice my listening while doing some exercise 18:50 is just side-hurting to listen and watch  (* ´艸｀)ｸｽｸｽ xie xie I think I can complete mr5 Thanks, that’s very helpful! Especially I like that you repeat each sentence 2 times right away. Because in same videos they are saying whole sentences and than repeat them again, which is not convenient) HAY! 很好  很用的 22 / 7 / 2020 good lesson thanks 椅子
左边右边 thank you  so much I got all most correct 在这个比如 （二十八），怎么”谁来 回答“ 意思 "who can answer"？ 
而且， 我们不知道的 ”来“ 的其他用途是什么呢？
我们怎么找？ 谢谢老师们，从越南 Went through all the lessons of this level twice, still hopeless xD Thank you question about the sentence at 21:50 - I thought "衣服" meant clothes. Can "一件衣服" mean a dress? Cool phone at 17:35 谢谢你老师。我喜欢你的上课 ！！！ If I didn’t come here, I wouldn’t have known,any people are learning mandarin.Good luck to everyone

Everything  upload in description 你好! 我非常喜欢你们的channel。
我的中文现在差不多hsk4-5的水平，所以我觉得我应该听一听更多真的每天用的中文。
你们可以给我推荐几个说中文的youtubers吗。(我的意思不是教中文的但是就很经常说中文的youtubers)

谢谢你们! 太棒了👏 謝謝您！ You guys should consider making a patreon or some donation page, some people might want to donate with your amazing work, of course ads is probably enough, but patreon or donation will probably make Everyday Chinese more sustainable, because this channel is too good to be cancelled. I'll definitely donate if you guys have some! cheers! For  24, isn't  supposed  to  be  "yin  tian"  for  overcast. Really helpful. I especially like it is all Chinese with no long English explanations. Perfect. Reprobé 😢 I like learning Chinese 真不错！我非常喜欢这个视频。我今天学习很多。非常感谢！但同时我惭愧的，因为我感觉我的听糟糕。
顺便请问？~我是开车去的~？

Its hard to practise listening Chinese, thank you for your hard work! Greatly appreciated! As someone who has confidently learnt HSK2 and some HSK3 I can't practise listening much at all! Omg this is really helpful! I'm 10 questions in, and although in study I know all of the words used.... actually in practise listening to it I can't recognise the words in conversation!

你有没有上课在微信？ 第37个呢，也可以说 “跑半个小时步” 吗？ at 16:01 "he telephoned" should be replaced by "he called"  I guess Word by Word translation and then complete sentence translation should be there to get maximum benefit from this couse. xie xie I learned more Chinese in this lesson just from the introduction.

Good luck Thank you Ms. Katrina I always learn new  chinese language every time I watch your videos,two years in Taiwan I can speak a little chinese now,more power to you😘😘😘 I think your lessons are very good. I’ve just recently found your videos and have a question. I’m confused on spacing between words in pinyin. In the last two sentences in one you do “yícì” and in the next one “yí cì” when you added please. Does the spacing matter in pronunciation? This is with traditional characters.. like shuo , jian.. What is the most popular to use it.. Traditional or simple characters?  Thanks Dear Katrina...I want to support you but can't give money every month. Do you have some lump sum payment plan to become lifetime petron... Just loud thinking... Learning Chinese.... 
Name Anil Vasant Moghe.. From Bangalore India.. Age 66. Does Zhi and chi pronounce the same? Xie xie ni lao shi Can't find part 5 plz Superb teaching, Katrina!! Honestly, feel like falling in love with your lessons... I think the pinyin for jiàn is not correct or perhaps you write it in traditional Chinese. You are a nice teacher , I really appreciate you. You are a great teacher! I'm just incapable of learning chinese or any second language obviously. But I still really enjoy the lessons anyway i worked at  chinese company mam so i need to learn chinese language   even its very hard   so please continue help us thank you you’re a good teacher  in chinese first timw watching your videos..i learn a lot I study Chinese in school because it is one of the requirement for acquiring i.d here in Taiwan,but still i dont know because they dont know how to speak english..But when  i saw your video,that's only the time i know some chinese language..Thanks for explaining clearly... so, if im buying something and i want 1 more.

My name is Beto, ans I'm from Brazil. And I have a question for you. Pay attention!
Every language works into a linguistic system. I think you already know that. For example, my language works into SVO/ SVC system. English languages work into the same way. So, and Chinese language!
