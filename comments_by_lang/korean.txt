I just came across your youtube channel and subscribed. I am interested to learn Korean language in addition to other languages I spoke and write. More power to you...Gamsahabnida!!! Why i'm Learning Korean:
- So I can read messages idols send and not risk them being a mistranslated to something else
-So I can sing along and understand more Kpop songs
- To prove I wasn't being lazy over the summer
- To learn something new
- So I can swear in front of my cousins and at school Download dulingo to learn full Korean step by step I... Forget it i just want to learn English I'm here because I wanna live in Korea and also because of kpop and kdrama ㅣ means "e" (vowel) 
ㅏ means "aa" (vowel) 
ㅇ (consonant)
Every syllable has one consonant and one vowel 
이 means teeth (ㅇis consonant and ㅣ is vowel)
아이 sounds as "aae" meaning child in korean - as  ㅣandㅏ both are void of consonants but according to rules each syllable should have 1 consonant and 1 vowel thus ㅇ is used in front of ㅣandㅏ ku orang indonesia nyasar sini Thank you! Only for BTS Gonna learn korean bc the translations on bubble when straykids text are so bad😭 First video I see from this channel and I LOVED IT!

Coming back to Korean. Love y video. Is it ju or yu? Thank you so mush cheacher 💓🦋💖 I have also notice that she whispers "okay" nicely 😃🙃🇰🇷💜🇮🇳 నేను భారతీయుడిని🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳, నాకు కొరియన్ భాష నేర్చుకోవడం అంటే ఇష్టం.నీ టీచింగ్ స్కిల్స్ బాగున్నాయి. I am from INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳, I interested to learn korean language and your teaching was so good.  It's difficult to pronounce some words How to speak korean What did she say about Heaven ground and man principle? Tonchiin voldy? I can't understand that tonchiin thingy. Can anyone spell out the word? The “we” pronunciations are very difficult because I don’t know the difference Actully it's pretty easy, even the prononciation, because we got similar pronociation in my birth language, and even worse than that. your explication is really great. i start today to learning. Thank you very much. How do I differentiate between letters that sound similar when writing? After 10 years🚶🏻‍♀️ tysm for these lessons jenny! It's super nice to hear the pronunciations from a native and learn the history behind it as well! this sister is so gentle Mam you did amazing work in this video ! Thank you very much ! the tiny "ok" is so cute Komowo Any army here who just learning korean for BTS😂 Learning Korean
2%-impress others
18%-to get job opportunities and increase my skills
80%-for my bias and dramas Vowels 8:54 13:25
Consonants 21:25 Very Nice.I found some french sounds , the unique till now for me russian i and arabic duplication of consonants. I learn korean language because i love k pop ,drama, actually i love everything  present in korean..... people in general: learn korean to listen to k-pop or because they like the language

me: learning korean to pay respect to comrade kim jong un こんいちは、はじめまして。 Truly appreciate all the EFFORTS that's been put into making this video and all the others too. Your "okay" at the end of every sentence has got me smiling ear to ear + the way you've explained it all 💖💖 I'm glad I bumped into this video though I learnt the basics yet this had been informative and good revision. Thank you so much. ❤️ Everyone is ganster until pronounciation came
Its confusing Thank you so much for letting people know Korean widely.👍 شكرا لك على مجهودك وين الترجمة Why is there only 13 basic consonants while you say 14 basic consonants It’s been two weeks and I didn’t give up I can proudly say I have a grip on this full lecture I am Chinese and seeing this lady teach Korean makes me agree the written Chinese language is really more difficult to learn. The inventors of the Korean written system were truly great minds. They really made it easier for Korean people to be literate. Some sounds are same to me (vowel sounds) 😔 Thank you eldo j is also a good korean teacher in youtube👍👍 8:55 Anyone here in 2021 당신의 한국어 수업을 보면서 많은 혜택을 얻었습니다.그 이후로 한국어가 많이 향상되었습니다.감사합니다,,,,, U know why I am here??








When I see bts in  dreams
I must respond
But I need to learn Korean first for that😂 Don't worry you will get BTS 3:00 there are only 13 consonants written J Very confused this sound I learn alphabet hangul and i want to know how to make a word  and how to use vowel and Consonante please tell me 💜💜💜 2021 is here guys 😎✌️ you said there is 14 consonant but it's 13 written here OMG: Korean letters sound like Mongolian. I did not know that :-) FOR BTS 💜💜💜 I'm trying to learn Korean because of BTS 💜💜😍😍 I absolutely love how helpful this video is and how she teaches. She makes it so easy to understand, I'm motivated to learn! I just learn korean because of bts and I love korean country😍i love to be a korean✨ Who's trying to learn Korean for BTS🤔...

🤭😃🎖️ ليش احس كوريا عبارة بس عن بي تي اس او هذا بس احساسي اني وحدي منو ايفكر نفسي😂btsاتمثل كوريا برمتها صح Learning Korean so that I can hear bts songs without subtitles 😅 الترجمة العربية موجودة بس ما تشتغل💔

من طرف k_pop abir💜 اين الترجمه العربيه؟ Thank u jenny for your time✌💜 Trying to learn but this is literally low fi asmr In korea, we usually pronounce ㅔ ㅐ, ㅖ ㅒ as same sound. You don't need to be annoyed to distinguish those vowels. 난 영어가 존나 어려운데..... How we can found that the sound [a]is not another a ...you know or [ya]...both are 2 different sound ..but how we can catch it??? Hi, thanks! Just the basic consonants are 13 if you count them..

My name is Elektra this is what I have seen I'm not sure if it's actually how you write it but 
엘렉트라 내 이름은 요간시야!!🖐🏻 My favourite place Korean 😍😍😍😍 I don’t know who did this but people who made the English pronunciation for Korean is stupid. Why they use “ae” for ㅔㅐ?? Or “eo” for ㅓ? Just read korean like Japanese, read it straightforward!

Read ㅐㅔ as “e” NOT “ae” just like Japanese 

Read ㅓ as “u” as in “umbrella” instead of “eo”!!

Why r people making korean pronunciation in English look so hard? I find the language interesting. The script, the pronountion, the culture and specially chopsticks 😂, I like it. What ...i know ..Ne is yes Hello hanguk onni please teach us how to use ,,because,, in korean Nae i- reum -eun poojaya. My name is Sonia already ends with ia 🤣 내 이름은 Sanika입니다 😅 Korean untie BTS : learning English for ARMY
