I am learning this language for you 🖤💗 Well, it's easy to learn the characters. The most difficult part is to learn the language, you have to learn literally every word there is in vocabulary, how to conjugate letters, sentence structures, all the exceptions, then learn commonly used slangs. You can "learn" the sentence structure but you have to "remember" the words. okay I thought of learning korean to watch live videos of my favs but this comment section is creepy as hell , many are learning korean so that they can marry their idols?? lmao -I am disgusted seriously !!! Learning for WINNER kpop boy group 💪💙✨ I am also learning because of bts im not here for bts nor kdrama, im just curious hehe Can u say should we pronounce it ahhhhh like lengthy or shorty ? learning korean for bts 
i am only 10 years old Thanx a lot to this channel I learnt reading Korean in almost no time.
Really I appreciate your efforts. Thank you and ya it's for BTS 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜.i learnt it 1 year ago from u thanks I even listen to korean kids alphabet song😭 Everyone is either learning this for Kpop or Kdrama. But im here so i can read manhwa raws 😐 You was making it so easy  thk you so much I can go to YG Entertainment for training so I have to learn Korean I’m learning for BTS I'm here because of Kdrama.. Here 99% are armies things im tired of hearing, regarding Korean culture in kpop and while learning Korean:

-they all look the same
-you can't understand it
-they're wearing makeup
-is that Chinese?
-they're so dramatic
-their english is so bad
-it all sounds the same
-what's Korean?
-I thought they were Chinese
-they're not like western artists
-they try too hard
-they dont even try
-but it's so easy
-it can't be self taught
and more

have a problem with any? tell me in the replies, i'll figh- i mean answer you myself ;)

I think everyone is learning korean for bts I am also learning this for listening to their song and their meet ups Aigooo. ARMY’s everywhere😂 i thought im the only one who visit this site because Bangtantv doesnt have subtitles😂 It's amazing to see that this video has published before even started BTS and now most of armies learn korean by watching this... Wow♥️ Some learning for the bts...but the true learners learning for traveling and talking with others... That word means child right? Others learning Korean: Kpop, Kdrama, BTS

Wow so I see I’m in the 0.01% of ppl not doing this for kdrama or kpop but cuz I genuinely wanna learn sum Korean 😭 I literally feel like I'm the only one that's attempting to learn Korean in order to then have a easier time learning Japanese and ultimately learn 2 more languages. Me here to learn for blackpink😌 Hi, I discovered your channel today. By the end of the video I really learned the two vowels ㅏandㅣ. :) -- Pushpa. I  cant believe that most are here to learn korean because of BTS. Including me.... I am just learning  for bangtan boys 9 years ago  but i just found this ! This is for BTS ❣️ I want to learn this language because i like to know more and more about korea that's why I need to learn language  first to coordinate with korean friends ❤️ I think most of the people are here for BTS 💜💜💜 I love you bts ❤️❤️🥰🥰❤️ Hi, Amy, this is very easy and helpful! I just came across your youtube channel and subscribed. I am interested to learn Korean language in addition to other languages I spoke and write. More power to you...Gamsahabnida!!! Why i'm Learning Korean:
- So I can read messages idols send and not risk them being a mistranslated to something else
-So I can sing along and understand more Kpop songs
- To prove I wasn't being lazy over the summer
- To learn something new
- So I can swear in front of my cousins and at school Download dulingo to learn full Korean step by step I... Forget it i just want to learn English I'm here because I wanna live in Korea and also because of kpop and kdrama ㅣ means "e" (vowel) 
ㅏ means "aa" (vowel) 
ㅇ (consonant)
Every syllable has one consonant and one vowel 
이 means teeth (ㅇis consonant and ㅣ is vowel)
아이 sounds as "aae" meaning child in korean - as  ㅣandㅏ both are void of consonants but according to rules each syllable should have 1 consonant and 1 vowel thus ㅇ is used in front of ㅣandㅏ ku orang indonesia nyasar sini Thank you! Only for BTS Gonna learn korean bc the translations on bubble when straykids text are so bad😭 First video I see from this channel and I LOVED IT!

I am from INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳, I interested to learn korean language and your teaching was so good.  It's difficult to pronounce some words How to speak korean What did she say about Heaven ground and man principle? Tonchiin voldy? I can't understand that tonchiin thingy. Can anyone spell out the word? The “we” pronunciations are very difficult because I don’t know the difference Actully it's pretty easy, even the prononciation, because we got similar pronociation in my birth language, and even worse than that. your explication is really great. i start today to learning. Thank you very much. How do I differentiate between letters that sound similar when writing? After 10 years🚶🏻‍♀️ tysm for these lessons jenny! It's super nice to hear the pronunciations from a native and learn the history behind it as well! this sister is so gentle Mam you did amazing work in this video ! Thank you very much ! the tiny "ok" is so cute Komowo Any army here who just learning korean for BTS😂 Learning Korean
2%-impress others
18%-to get job opportunities and increase my skills
80%-for my bias and dramas Vowels 8:54 13:25
Consonants 21:25 Very Nice.I found some french sounds , the unique till now for me russian i and arabic duplication of consonants. I learn korean language because i love k pop ,drama, actually i love everything  present in korean..... people in general: learn korean to listen to k-pop or because they like the language

me: learning korean to pay respect to comrade kim jong un こんいちは、はじめまして。 Truly appreciate all the EFFORTS that's been put into making this video and all the others too. Your "okay" at the end of every sentence has got me smiling ear to ear + the way you've explained it all 💖💖 I'm glad I bumped into this video though I learnt the basics yet this had been informative and good revision. Thank you so much. ❤️ Everyone is ganster until pronounciation came
Its confusing Thank you so much for letting people know Korean widely.👍 شكرا لك على مجهودك وين الترجمة Why is there only 13 basic consonants while you say 14 basic consonants It’s been two weeks and I didn’t give up I can proudly say I have a grip on this full lecture I am Chinese and seeing this lady teach Korean makes me agree the written Chinese language is really more difficult to learn. The inventors of the Korean written system were truly great minds. They really made it easier for Korean people to be literate. Some sounds are same to me (vowel sounds) 😔 Thank you eldo j is also a good korean teacher in youtube👍👍 8:55 Anyone here in 2021 당신의 한국어 수업을 보면서 많은 혜택을 얻었습니다.그 이후로 한국어가 많이 향상되었습니다.감사합니다,,,,, U know why I am here??

엘렉트라 내 이름은 요간시야!!🖐🏻 My favourite place Korean 😍😍😍😍 I don’t know who did this but people who made the English pronunciation for Korean is stupid. Why they use “ae” for ㅔㅐ?? Or “eo” for ㅓ? Just read korean like Japanese, read it straightforward!

Read ㅐㅔ as “e” NOT “ae” just like Japanese 

Read ㅓ as “u” as in “umbrella” instead of “eo”!!

Why r people making korean pronunciation in English look so hard? I find the language interesting. The script, the pronountion, the culture and specially chopsticks 😂, I like it. What ...i know ..Ne is yes Hello hanguk onni please teach us how to use ,,because,, in korean Nae i- reum -eun poojaya. My name is Sonia already ends with ia 🤣 내 이름은 Sanika입니다 😅 Korean untie BTS : learning English for ARMY

This is true love ❤️❤️ I want to learn Korean so I can talk in Korean but my parents and grandparents won’t know anything I’m saying شكرا الك استفدنا اكتير 
Thank you 
Whats your name It's Jin njaa helpful gomavoyo,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍Hi everyone! Thank you for learning Hangul with me :)
I've been asked by many beginner learners "What should I learn next after the alphabets?"
and hopefully the blog post I wrote (Beginner's Guideline to Korean) helps you figure out
what to learn next step by step.
You can find it here: https://explorekorean.com/2020/09/10/beginners-guide-to-korean-%f0%9f%93%9d/

*One correction in the video:
ㅌ's name is "티읕," and not "티긑."
Strangely ㄷ's name is "디귿,"
so I thought ㅌ's name would work the same, but turns out it's not.
It anyways has "t" sound, so it doesn't affect how you read/pronounce it :)

한국어 공부 화이팅! ^^ My best wishes on your studies.♥ THIS WAS REALLY HELPFUL 😃 I ALREADY LEARNED SO MUCH AND I FEEL LIKE IM ON THE RIGHT TRACK! THANK YOU❤️🥰 90% of the viewers of this video is here to learn Korean so as to understand the BTS. im so confused like i dont know the englsh translation is that how its meant to be or I feel like im hearing an alien language. Literally goes so fast😭...😂 Can someone please explain 23:55 ? How is it 'gwa' 6:48 It's my korean learning starting.
This is for me to see after some months or one year how I improved from this day. The best way to learn Korean is by watching lots of Kdramas and movies. Let's say most of us are here for BTS. It feels like kindergarden all over again I like how she said gun so enthusiastically Everything was making sense until you added that patzim thing at the end. are ㅗ and ㅓ pronounced the same ? ( as o ) Thank you for taking your time to teach Vicky. Really appreciate the time you take to make these videos to help/give advice to others. ㅅ ㄱ I’m just learning Korean just to speak to my roblox brother 🤣🤣🤣 Im not a korean person but i would love to learn korean FOR HELP WITH ㅡ JUST THINK OF THE DISGUSTED SOUND ONE MAKES BUT FRENCH 4:00

I love you it really helped me thank you so much These all are  letter are reading for  BTS omg it's been hella difficult to find someone who teaches something aside from just the alphabet. Thank you very much :) 배심 is so confusing for me :(. I know it's a final consonant and it changes the pronunciation slightly but there is so much variation D:. Ok but I feel like I'm the only one learning this bc of Mystic Messenger- will need to learn the meaning of the words trying to learn to write or read firstly before trying to learn to read and write Hangul Im Learning korean ...tomorrow is my English semister exam 😇😇😇😇... ㅇ  ㅁ ㄱ ㅋ ㄹ ㅍ ㄷ ㅂ ㅅ ㅌ ㅈ  h m g k r pd  s th Wow~ It's amazing that this video has 3,859,633 views! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Tysm for making me not end up like oli London It doesn't feel depressed when we feel during normal study it hits somethin different;) ㄱㄴ г ن  similar hebrew I regret not learning way earlier, now its almost time for me to go back to school when I could of been learning this whole quarantine when I had all the time and didn't have anything to do.

Me at 2 am on a random night: trying to learn korean so i can actually watch kdramas without being stressed as fuck trying to read the captions fast enough THANK YOU SO MUCH, i thought Korean was just some random symbols and after watching millions of videos, i figured out what these symbols mean and now i am starting to learn Korean. the begging: 😍😍😍😍
after double consonant: 😰😰😰😰 the begging: 😍😍😍😍
after double consonant: 😰😰😰😰 those "wa weo wi, etc" vowels are the ones that I alwayssss seem to struggle learning. Everything else I pick up on. Its those 18 27:57
(ignore my comment lol) It's a bit easy to learn Korean for me beacuse I am from India so ofcourse I know hindi and the alphabet pronunciation of some words are similar to Korean :)
This was very detailed video though, 감사합니다!! THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH 🥰 AESPA WAIT FOR ME OKAY BTS is the reason I'm here...and I am loving Korean rn speaking japanese in korean. Hmm a lot of the sounds we have in hungarian language too. Like iu ü for us pronounced the same. And so on. I hope I can learn Korean language on my own with your help. 😊 Thank you so much!!!! Its really help me. Tqqq 16:00 Sun and Smell have the same S sound in English I'm more like a visual person, so the picture really helps! I like to imagine each word with something I know so that I can understand better :) i feel im baby me in between the video: can I read her name yet? hold up? bi- bi what? khi? what the heck? I feel like I'm illiterate. bi ga khi sam? is it supposed to be like that? I know army's  are everywhere 😂💜💜💜 I haven't sleep for 30 hours so thanks for this video. Very relaxing voice IF FELIX CAN DO IT IN 8 MONTHS I CAN TOO This video is amazingly well done. I learned the Korean alphabet during my second tour there, but never learned the language, except for a few very basic words. I could write English words using Hangul and that was fun, but I now have a horrible memory (that was 20 years ago also.) 
My best friend is Korean and I would love to talk to her in her native language and have been trying to get past the first lesson in Duolingo. YOUR video is going to help me so very much! I was ready to quit and now I won’t. Thank you so much! like i am writing chinese characters stroke by stroke Trying to read Kakao novels The last part is totally gone through over my head I didn’t understand anything from the last part 😞😞 I’m doing this for namjoon This is very helpful, especially the way to remember consonants, thanks very much! :D You just said theres a difference.
Eh
Yeh
Aeih 
Yie 빅키샘 Ms. Vicky, I like your word association techniques.

If cool with you and my fellow Korean language learners, I'm gonna share what has helped me remember the characters too:
1. ㄱ= G. ㄱ looks like the number 7. As of year 2021, we are getting awed by 5 G. Of course in the future it will be 7 G. 7 G would be Great. Make the "G" sound, write the number 7 or the Korean character ㄱ. Link in your mind 7 or ㄱ and G. 
ㄱ = G.

2. ㄷ = D. The character ㄷ looks like the letter C. In the olden days, yikes, early 90s, you were the coolest kid if you had a portable Compact Disk or CD Player. So, think of CD, CD, CD.  The ㄷ character looks like C. Think ㄷD, ㄷD, ㄷD.
ㄷ  = D. 

Just these for now. Daedanhee gamsahamnida, you helped me a lot I've learnt so much 🤗 yay i can now (kinda) read manwhas that arent translated Fun fact: the ''eu'' sound you make is equivalent to the sound of ''y'' in the Guarani language from Paraguay I found this pretty easy to learn particularly the consonants. Most vowels are simple except for a couple because the pronunciation changes slightly with the letter combinations and can vary according to the regional dialect. Think the difference between Alabama and New York as an example. Once you get the vowels down it is shockingly easy to learn Korean by reading it in Hangul rather than an anglicized version! It helps that I have Koren wife that helps me but she speaks the Seoul area dialect so my pronunciation might annoy people from Busan!😉 **Kpop Fans Entered The Chat** The names are confusing me 🙂🙃 Thank you so much for this video 🙂🙂🙂🙂 Nobody gives a shit if you came here because of BTS or nah, just stfu, people really be seeking for the attention they don't get at home 😂 Me: I am a Native Spanish Speaker, I can speak English, and I am Intermediate with American Sign Language (and still learning)
Also me: I want to learn Korean and Italian. aawww!!!! thankyouu very muchh!!! i had just a feeling that, i became a master of korean after learning for 36 min straight!!!  thankyou!!! saranghaee unniee.. This sounds like a g because it looks like a *gun*
This sounds like a k because you use the gun to *kill people*

I'm dying laughing omg Wait Bangtan, Just wait... Korean is not that easy that I thought. Oh god its english but asian,they said  it was easy!!! Do You Know The ㅚ I need to Translate the book 240 pages from English to Korean, Can you do that? I will pay you. Am I the only one who wants to learn korean cause I want to live in the country, not becuase of kpop lol Why everyone else is learning korean: BTS, BlackPink, Kdrama 

Why I'm learning korean: To procrastinate learning  japaneseY’all k pop lovers really dedicated to be learning a whole language i started a few days ago at first i was like what 90 mins bet......me 5 days later lolzzzzzz its a learning process i like it i hope i become fluent in korean learning from you sumbae 조회수보소 korean dramas, u are under arrest for making me do this👮‍♂️ Reason why i am learn korean

1 for understand what bts members speaking
2 for bts run episodes 
3 try to understand easily their songs
4 try to learn korean for BTS BTS BTS
ONLY.😘😍😚 2021 ? It's really funny for me, pronouncing the Korean words as those word mean a lot of things in Hindi like saath, paan, cheen- it's hilarious. this is going to be the third language i learn!! (i'm already intermediate in french and russian) so i'm really excited :D Hey Billy :)
I have a question (anyone who can help me can answer)
There are six syllable blocks with minimum two and maximum four consonants and vowels in total. Now do you also use the syllable blocks with four for the double consonants? Or would the double consonants count as two? Diphthongs: 

57:29 ㅘ
58:00 ㅢ
58:37 ㅝ 
58:50 ㅟ
59:12 ㅞ
59:29 ㅘ
59:43 ㅙ
1:00:05 ㅚ

Practice: 1:00:28 

(edit: I made this list because it was really difficult for me to remember the sounds (it took me a lot longer to memorize the combined vowels compared to all the other vowels) feel free to use this as much as you need) bestest explanation so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 the reason why i want to learn hangul so that I can write my diary in another language so that my siblings won't tease me because they cant read korean 😜 I DO THIS  FOR BTS🤣💜 Are you korean bro? what does "k-ah" mean? it's the first word in the video i just wanna know what ASTRO are tweeting.. without using google translate. ive watched so many kdramas and shows these past 10 years that i understand a lot of words and sentences... and even when i dont understand i can get the feeling of what they're talking about This will be useful for Korean learners like me:

NOTE: The first letter of the words in English is the letter for Korean


ㅂ: Bucket

ㅎ: Hat

ㄱ: gun

ㄹ: Rattlesnake


ㄴ: Nose

ㅍ: Part Two

ㄷ: Door

ㅌ: Two doors

ㅇ: no sound or "NG"

ㅁ: Mouth

ㅈ: j

ㅊ: ch

ㅅ: Standing Yall. We need to make him famous.  The amount of dedication put into this is astronomical.     Duolingo can never I finished this video in one sitting and now I feel drained lmao okay lets do this again wish me luck this time! Stray kids really got me here learning a whole foreign language... other ppl: *learning korean for kpop*
me: *learning it to flex on ppl* Other learning korean for :-Study , job ,etc
Me (army) learning korean for :- BTS 
Look what you are making me do BTS 😁 when you already know the language but you just bored- BTS made me do this To all those trying to learn Korean, don't lose hope. It takes time to learn new things but the results are worth it. You will be able to learn Korean in about 3 months if you study for 7-10 hours a week. About fluency, it will take max a year [depends on your learning speed]. But people should be constructive and invest their time in something beneficial for them. SO GO FOR IT CUZ YOU CAN DO IT. There are many wrong vowels Kdrama and bts make me want to learn it 🥺 51:24 my first video of learning hangul. its helps me a lot. thank you! Things I do for BTS 😭 It is crazy that I am trying to learn Korean by watching English tutorials. English is my second language. 😂😂😂😂 Any bts army here!? Lmao im here just because i wanna read raw manhwas Am I the only one who is not here for Kpop.? Just preparation time for attending bts fansign... Armys can relate 💜..
They learning English for armies nd armies learning korean.. Tell me wht else is true love If I had practiced this much for my Exams I would come in FIRST place Because of Seventeen I'm here ❤️ 24:54 i got 19/20 i still learning🤗😇 Reasons why im learning korean:
•0,1% its a beautiful languege
•0,2% for kdrama
• 0,2% Kpop
• 0,5% to show off to others
• 99% to curse at people in korean Why m I here cz.... There language sounds so cute when they talk like annyeon, oissu it sounds really cute after all the k dramas I have watched I m finally here to learn thos language and I hope I don't mess up XD me: it's a tough language
also me: but i'm gonna do it anyhow :) This is actually super easy to follow and helpful, great guide for begginers👌🏼❤️ I could learn hangul in 2 days y'all here for kpop while I'm here to read manhwa without having to hop through bad translations lol it was a nice journey learning hangul. Thanks Please help meeee!😭 I think it's a beautiful thing that music can inspire the love of a new culture enough that you'd wanna learn the language to better understand the sentiment behind the lyrics. This is only part of my reason, anyone else?🙋‍♀️ 25:16 I've learned how to read and write hangul the same year this video was posted. Nostalgic. I am learning hangul for BTS While learning it the only thing come in my head is i known the words now but wat about the meaning of it and how to say it????? I'm learning how to sing. I'm learning how to dance. I'm learning korean, so if i grow up I'll never suffer on learning it and gonna go to seoul for my pre-debut and I'm gonna try to do some audition to be kpop😭 Youre the best. I want to learn Korean grammar because it's a bit different from English grammar so firstly we have to learn that after this and than we can learn meaning of the words so than I think it will became easier...
But it's taking so much time to learn through videos....
But we are very dedicated to this language! I am not going to give this up!
We can do it! 🥰 Fighting 👍 The reason im here to learn korean because of kdrama 🤧,so i can watch without sub title. My brother always saying:*ugh watching kdrama even if you dont understand,your such a koreaboo 😂* thats why 😩 Me : T_T BTS please put subtitles
BTS : I am sorry 
Me : T_T me not understanding anything  still Korean drama....look what you are making me do!  😁🤩😜 Can you make a series about Korean grammar This is the best video I have ever seen to learn the Korean alphabet thank you so much for the amazing video you teach so good in a way that anyone will understand If I still can't join the NCT fansign or work at SM after this, I'll burn that company 😌🖐🏻 Thanks too too much. 70% for kpop
10% so i can look cool in front of my siblings watching korean youtube vids/kdramas without subtitles
10% wanna go to korea for college
10% i wanna have convos with ppl i dont like and in korean, to make them confused and also insult them in korean and they wont understand a thing 1;22;32 this rule used when no other sound change rules already being used.what does that mean bro? All the concepts is clear to me accept 13 and 14 part 😭 Is it really effective?? 18:44 If their is another sound change am gone literally only at lesson 3 and i'm losing my mind sjvsvsvs It's really helpful I am trying to learn it thx 💜😄 This is all because of K pop i can now read korean characters because of this. IKON  and kdramas made me want to learn it😊 13:25 I'm here so that I can understand what TWICE speaks during their Vlive. It's a very long journey but I hope I can finally understand them in real time. I want to go to Seoul university when I’m older to study and multiple people have said it better to learn younger so I decide to learn now lmao <3 한글 "Khaa" and "Gaaa" of K and G sounds so close to Hindi or Gharwali.... I plan to do my postgraduate in SNU so getting a headstart now! Though I should probably learn French first considering how I'm doing my undergraduate in Canada 🤦🏻‍♀️ Study, study, study! I am grateful for this series. I am learning in order to better care and be a companion to my elderly Korean Mother-In-Law. She retired in 2015 and was widowed in 2017 and doesn't have coworkers or my American Father-In-Law to speak English with everyday. She admits watching KBS and talking to her sisters in Incheon, almost daily, has caused her to revert back to thinking in Korean. I realized I needed to learn at least some rudimentary Korean when she took me to the safety deposit box at the bank to show me where the important documents were and the envelopes and files were all labeled in Hangul!  On another occasion we were in the grocery store and she began telling me something in Korean and I could only stare blankly. I fear what would happen if she developed dementia in the future. I think learning Korean will help grow my relationship with this woman I have been friends with for nearly 40 years and family with for the last 21. I know it will be a challenge to learn a new language in my 50s, but it will so be worth the effort to have more in common with my mother-in-law who is my dear friend. I'm here because of my girl JESSI I came because i am tired of being confused in vlive post  and because if rm can learn of friends i can learn of billy and because i like the language and also teird of reading subtiles Okay as an indian i dont know why but many words are hindi sounding 😂 and its easier 😂😂 thank you for putting this here for free and with such amazing explanation!! I can read hangul so easily now it is amazing how you get straigth to the point and just explain so clearly Maybe I'm the only one learning korean for manhwa This video really helpful. Thank a lot !! Reasons why I'm here
- i love their culture
- so I can watch kdramas without subs
- because of twice For my musician friends: double consonants are like staccato while strong consonants are more like marcato this was SUPER helpful thank you! my only complaint is the use of stylized font for teaching words and phrases. it makes things very difficult to read as a beginner. other than that, great video i just want to understand BTS and now i am here compared to Chinese and Japanese, I found this very easy but I am nowhere near anywhere being any proficient in it. I learned Spanish-Japanese-Chinese_Fuzhounese & Now Hangul_korean... Time for learninggg... thanks billy! 안녕하세요 선생님, 저는 리사 이에요!
i just wanted to tell you how much i appreciate and want to thank you for the effort you put into this video. i learned the most parts/rules of hangul (except for the sound changing rules) a few months ago through several different youtube videos. most of them were said to "teach hangul in under 5 minutes" or something similar. even tough i know how to read, write and use hangul for the most parts i still watched this whole video (on 1,25 speed tho) and i really wish that i'd have already watched it months ago because the way you explain everything it really easy to understand the language. the sound changing rules that you explained in the last 10-15 minutes were completely new to me so i am very happy that i still watched the whole video. korean is the fourth/fith language that i am learning at the moment and i could say that i see the biggest improvements so far which makes me very happy since i'm not taking any classes and my whole knowledge of korean basically came from korean music, dramas and youtube videos.
i'm not gonna continur writing writing this long a** comment but i just hope that you know how much your work helps people like me and i'm very thankful for that:) it's literally the best explanation video i have ever watched<3 💀🔫 i get confused on how to say the last one idk of its tah or pah 💀🔫 Who else is learning Korean because it’s got a simple alphabet, a logical grammar system, and loads of great online resources? :( I'm learning Korean for BTS 🙂💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 like seriously, it still  hard to ditinguish for each letters

NCT / WAYV influencing me to be polyglot :3 thank youGet your FREE account here : https://goo.gl/YejSNo i woke up and this still plays. thank you i had a very good night sleep if you're sleeping you're not learning anything I just here to know what bts saying on thier lives haha This video is very helpful. My fiance is Korean and will be doing a vacation with his family this winter and going to Korea to meet the rest of them next year! I'm very anxious about not embarrassing myself lol. I wanna learn Korean language because I wanna know what BTS says in my dream😂🙂 and also I want to go south Korea as if BTS would say anything than I may understand. Borahaaaaaaaaaaaaaae 💜 Architecture students can't have a normal sleeping night and then you see 8 hours ! :,) but well today is my first day of holidays i'll enjoy continue learning korean again If you leave you phone on for 8 hours you will be lowbat Me, a chinese person, speaks English and Spanish, can understand baby level chinese and that's it: I want to learn Korean/Japanese!

Man if my parents knew that I'd rather learn Korean and Japanese over Chinese I have no idea what would happen to me. Pretty sure I have a problem lol. U think we get 8 hrs of sleep? Ur too cute🥲 Learning Japanese for Anime ✅
Learning Korean for Kpop ✅
Speaking My Native Language ❌
i hate english sm 😭 ARMY did it work for anyone??? I’m here so I can communicate with Koreans 2nd day I just want to be able to watch kdramas without subtitles 😩 Ngl learning Japanese was easier than learning korean lmao bt I’m still learning I got addicted to kdrama that's why I want to learn their language. Luckily, I memorized the consonants and vowel and I can also read. The hard thing to learn is how to pronounce correctly but I have a lot of time, so I can manage to learn it in no time. I've known some words too and guess what I'm just learning korean for about 5 or 6 days. 00:24
8:01:40 Me after waking up: mUl JuSeYo Well…. Does it work? How many here for just learning korean? Less than a minute and its "Old My Nigga". I like this 😀 I want to listen but NOT WITH ADS that’s fucked up My parents walk in- wut da fuck💀 And you get up and start talking in korean🗿 Imagine waking up only speaking korean😀 i love how were making an effort to learn a different language to make it easier for us but also easier for other people.- Army💜 The only class you're allowed to sleep in 0:24 I think for thanks u it's not Well no one asked but I'm here because I wanna watch that one show called 'hello jadoo' which still has no subtitles in some eps I’m here because I love learning new languages and because of BTS. Right I’m familiar with Spanish and of English is my first language. After Korean, French maybe next. It doesn’t matter why anyone is here. What matters is that we learn. Me: Trying to learn Korean while sleeping
Ad: Russian guy talking about chicken nuggets Start: 00:24 Im here because of bts and blackpink Anyone here for
(G)_i_dle
*Neverland* Someone tell me if it works 🤧 omg guys i just woke up and now i can speak korean Is Gomawoeyo and Gamsahamnida the same thing for North and South Korea? Could they be used interchangeably? I tried to sleep while leaving this on but I can't sleep lol I’m going to Korea but I know 
Barely anything 😭😭 Imagine waking up speaking fluent Korean Is it really working in a sleep? Because I read somewhere that people don't remember what they heard in sleep because brain didn't take voice from ear in sleep Bts 4ever "Learn Korean wHILE SleEping"
Me: Starts to sleep


















Ad: win the Hyundai Tucsson Am I the only one who is about to fall asleep but then the voice for the english scares the shit out of you This has to be a constant listening tool to learn this. Thanks for sharing. Everyone here because of BTS
Me: I like SHINee y’all… me: *sleeps with this*
when I wake up:.... ONIONSGRASEIYO OPPAR HINCHA SARANGHEY “I don’t want to be brainwashed in my sleep.”

As opposed to the brainwashing you get when you’re awake. Whos here because y’all wanna understand what BTS is saying (or any kpop group/idol) and K-dramas? 😀
🙋🏻‍♀️ I sleep 9 hours🧍🏻‍♀️ I'm only here bc I wanna watch BTS RUN without reading Playing this for 8hours
My battery : 💥 This video is the most commonly video. Edited : See, how many views are there for this video ! Because, I learn korean in this video repeatedly. Igeoro halgeyo ! 🇯🇵 When I heard it doesn’t fit I lmao I’m going to hell for how I think That's why if we learn Korean while you sleeping tomorrow morning. Aye stop with the jokes does this really work!? Lmao me: Oh learn korean while you sleep lets do it

also me: *wakes up* wAe guRoJi mOlA..... *realizes jyp brainwashed me* welp Has this actually helped anyone, I want to start learning but i dont have enough hours during the day, has anyone actually tried this for like a week or so and realised whether it has worked or not only bts Zones out thinking about bts moments and memes* I'll learn from taehyung's asmr  😂 안녕하세요 한국에서 이제 감사합니다 Vidoe teaching:do u speak  English?
Apps:BREAD This is south korean reason or north Korea please tell me Newbie here, and I can't sleep with this. 🤣🤣lmao “According to research, it's possible for your brain to establish links between words in two languages while you're asleep. That means sophisticated learning is possible while you're snoozing — which could aid you when learning a new language” ...😳 bruh, i just wanna go to a fully funded korean university If you don't know how it works this is how: when you wake up your brain is more open and makes it easier to learn korean What I noticed in the video after hearing for 2hours is that it I have been listening to the same set of sentences throughout the video. Then straight I deleted this video from my downloads in YouTube and went back to sleep Everyone: here because of BTS
Me: because I love learning languages🤷🏻‍♀️ I feel like😐

🥲🤦🏻‍♀️

 oil London comes here everyday 😭😭😂 your  here bc kpop or kdrama I couldn't last for 8 hrs so i turned it off in just 2 hrs my brain was tired 🤯....when i woke up i could only recall "chunchanhae jullaseyo," idk if u write this way ..

. How can anyone "sleep" With these stupid ads??? WTF I did this for Chinese  now I'm fluent in Russian. God when I'm going to learn korean🥺😭 i speak korean how did i get here?? lolol anyway the first thing (i didnt go far hhh) wasnt what to say for elders! be carful with these BTW how can someone sleep with the sound on😭😭.. Feel like someone is in the room.. So scary🙄 I think its really effective.. I've learned how to speak korean and im fluent..  




Me: but only in my dreams..  awww. ✌️😂🤣✌️when i wake up. Ang sakit ng tenga ko!! 🤣😂🤣 Does this really work? Does it work Guys does it work? What if i forget my own mother tongue 🤣🤣🤣 Everyone: *sleeping and listening *

Me: *still awake 8hrs later repeating everything * Im trying to learn Korean so that I wouldn't be reading Subs anymore in Kdramas and BTS runs😀And to Understand Vlives😃Imma make Namjoon proud Uwau Video : Could you find me a non-smoking room?
Also Video : BASIC Phrases
Me : 😶 So....this is a repetation of common phrases for how many loop, don't know...can't count d i literally already speak italian german and english i’m studying russian and chinese and only bc if kpop i’m trying to learn a sixth language dear god why ayo can someone tell if it worked honestly no one gaf about why you’re listening to this no offense but dayum thank you is gamsamda 0:41 "oh my nigga!" When you realize the phrases are just repeating over and over 👁👄👁 Is this Native or Hangul???? It doesn’t sound like what I usually hear I thought that there are 8 hours of new sentences in this video, but it's just a few sentences that are repeating. Kinda dissapointed. How can you learn while sleeping like literally i always listen to this like this is for the 100th time but i still didn't learn enything Have you considered a version where you repeat the phrase 5 times instead of just 3 times? I would like that even better! I have q

me : does this for *twice seventeen itzy onlyoneof ateez oneus nct kard and stray kids* gonna wake up fluent after this 유익한 방송입니다~♡ Me thinking ill wake up speaking fluent Korean i would listen to this i only get like 4 hours of sleep ㅋㅋㅋ :D im probably the only person here who is NOT learning korean for BTS (even if i love when Jungkook opens his sweet mouth to sing, that saying just nearby lol) but i dont listen to them much (only few single songs here and there if i like, like the "truth untold" song) 

but i confess, i sing for so many years now korean songs (and i mean NOT only kpop songs lol)
and after so many years im since 5-6month now learning korean intensively bcos i found through music alot korean friends too and id watched so many movies and dramas as well + love the food , the culture , country + much more .... 

i dunno why im so late starting it tbh, but like i said....a few month ago i was waking up like:
YES. TODAY i start.
ITS fkn time to learn korean now. lol 

my wish is to know write and speak korean fluently just like my english is fine too - so i can watch news and movies without english subs omg, thats my goal lol :D
to understand friends what they say or write , and answer them without an translator helping me out pfff :) 

i love how the korean language sounds +im a person who is a language-lover so i hope it will work out for me, that i will be able to learn korean + can speak it soon (even if not perfectly but to communicate) lol 
its just damn difficult (yes yes it is, stop kidding me you all who said : korean is so easy.) its sooo NOT. lol
the only easy thing about korean is - to learn hangeul, yes that... but language isnt that easy hehe <3 <3 

i think the idea to "learn while sleeping" is a good one
there is a possibillity that our brain will capture it and save it (well i hope my brain will lolol) :D It's very hard l only know Korea one word is sarangeo means love you l see bts says sarangeo Y’all will wake up with a dead phone 8 hours 🤓😵😵 some of the Korean pronunciations are off ._. Me: *Having dreams in Korean*
Also me: *Communicates back in english* Imagine waking up talking korean 👁👄👁 thanks for the binaural added Tell me why i crammed the ads Kamsahumnida Arigatoo gozaimasu What a wonderful vedio to learn korean...bangawoyo..nice to meet you Pretty sure Im learning this phrases just for Jimin......aaaahhhhhh...

Did this work for anyone? I wanna know 🙂 Aniyo🐤 Oli should watch this like im so sick of him saying those korean words that i even myself whos not korean knows that it was pronounce very wrongly(and yet he teach how to speak korean a real korean im dying) It's a cute language 💜 like bts Not easy to learn,i swear,hard to pronounce😢 How to say

Army's learning Korean🤣 I want to learning,,bcz of BTS and it's so interesting language 💜💜💜 Hello army's 🤗.Army runs are higher here than normal guys.💜 purple you army's 💜💜 are u german or live in germany because i hear a littke german accent in ur english :) The reason behind I wanted to learn Korean is just for Bangtan's💜💜
Is there any army here??
BTS 💜 Army Forever I’m confused on fact 4, wdym? where  are armies? Korean Unnie-----------at first indians were only obsessed with native europeans but now, as far east is steadily on the rise, more and more indians are obsessed with us and japan even china.  Every body "loves" a winner and that "love " is not real. you are so beautiful BTS are so meant for us.
We can do anything for our angles, learning korean is no difficult than to see Bangtanbombs without subtitles!
Yes AMRYS? No more request to Bighit.
ARMYS are so talented that they can learn korean for BTS💜
Agree ARMYS? So AMRYS are here just because no subtitles available for Bangtanbombs❤️ BTS: learn English for ARMY
ARMY: learn Korean for BTS
ME: came to learn Korean bt end up with army
UTube: yes army this is Ur world
WORLD: we are the ARMY...go away Corona When you want to learn Korean just to be smarter than your friend- Masculine and feminine (gender nouns) for people who are wondering and are a little bit  confused. Is not used in English. When I learned french, certain objects and stuff kindaaa had a gender.. Exampleee: La(feminine) chaise, not le(masculine)chaise. Which translates into the chair. It's a bit complex to be honest, but there are little tricks and tips to help you learn!! 😀😀 99.9 people are Armies.... 😆😍😘 감사합니다  ♡⚧ Fun fact: *90% of the comment section is a kpop stan* Who’s wants learn Korean because of bts?! i 'm here because of V💜 Teaching korean and English subject verb and agreement thanks for it You really remind me of Sana from twice. By the way it helped me, thank you 💗 Ma'am u r very cutee🥰🥰one of the beautiful lady ❤you almost look like Jisoo🖤💗 BTS learning English for 🅐🅡🅜🅨⁷⟬⟭

👇🏻 me and my cousin want to learn korean because we want to talk and our parents won’t know what we are saying 🤡


























(my personal reason is bang tan tho) helpful in bengali we also follow suject+object+verb rule. I am here for blackpink can you give an example on fact num.4 ? Korean is similar to Hindi and Tamil so thats mean indian people can learn Korean fast. 😀 You are soooooooo cute🥰
❤️❤️ love from Bangladesh 🥰🥰 All army's are here for just learning Korean because of our previous 7 jems name Kim namjoon Kim seokjin min yoongi jung hoseok park jimin Kim taehyung jeon junkook sorry for the spellings love you bts 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Edit : thanks you soooooooooooooooooooooo much guys for the likes in this comment love you Oh so many army's are here so I didn't get any subject I'm an Indian army, and I think after this video I actually know Korean better than Hindi!!😂( Ps: I'm terrible at Hindi even tho it's my mother language 😂) For hindi speaker learning Korean might be a little easy since the alphabets' s pronounciation are similar instead Hindi has more varied letters. Also, even our sentence structure is same as Korean, so it's just like same sentence just change the words.

Tamil born in pandya kingdom by shivan as soma sundra pandian parvathy as meenakshi murugan as ukkira pandiyan agasthiyar is a sage part of tamil siddhar or tamil sangam member so tamil born in hands of the shiva he created tamil language himself by the guidelines of shiva agasthiyar created tamil grammar agasthiyar tamil guru is murugan and murugan guru is shivan, parvathy

Love from india I literally write the whole thing and i cant feel my hand anymore😭 but this is very helpful so thank u so much 🥰 It's good for learning.
But she walking 100G fast so I'm not happy her video. Wow...
U looked like blackpink rose😨😨..are u her sister?......
Anyway thank you😃😍😘 고마워요😊 Yes m learning Korean but not because of bts Tq unnie Is there any armyzzz here to learn korean for BTS ?????😂😀 I wansta learn korean to communicate with BTS 💜😉😘 i know this and that because of chenji I need this thank you Great job unie 4:37 i dont get the point why both 이 랑 and 그리고 mean "and" in english but being used differently?
and if we use 이 랑 and  랑 at the end of every listed word then we dont need to use object particles or subject markers right? very very good teaching teacher Learning for my Korean trip and for EXO. Thanks for this.. Can i ask? I thought juseyo means please give me? I already know how to form words and now im learning how to form sentences, so this really helped I know how to read but I don't know what those it means So useful Xd I like u After 6 years I find this video and this is really helpful The first sentence I got to know is
"kimchirang jeotgarakirang mul juseyo" which means kimchi and chopstick and water please🥺 My goal in april 2020:Okay so I have to be fluent in Korean till May 2021
Me in May 2021: still searching how to learn Korean..! 펜이랑 시트랑 지우개 주세요.
Is it right sentence? 
I used irang after pen because pen end with the consonant n so irang is right or not and I used rang after sheet because sheet ends with eu  vowel  so is it ok. I am not understanding why jom is put into the sentences?  If it means a bit or a little, why does "menyupan jom juseyo" mean "menu please", and not "menu a little please?" HEY LIKE IN SOME SENTENCES YOU DIDNT USE eedang/dang YOU DIRECTLY USED  hotello ga juseyo IS IT NECESSARY TO USE THOSE OR WE CAN DIRECTLY WRITE THE SENTENCE BY SKIPPING THEM AND THANKU FOR THE WONDERFUL VIDEO And me too Yes my friends 감사합니다 누나 😇 과 Take Care  누나 😇 Helpful I watching 2021😂😂 Learned all the basic sentences in lockdown Thanks dii I am from India and I understand thank you so much Yes Wait I don’t fully understand 좀, is it to make it more polite? Because give me a little bit menu doesn’t really make sense imagine waking up the next day and speaking korean fluently. THis was really helpful, Thank you! if gyesak means calculation/pay how do you say i want to calculate the pay? The ROMAJI really helped a lot. Color coding the words with romaji will also make it a lot easier to learn vocabulary. Where are the blinks at? <3 Thank you so much this helped my Korean alot This is Formal or informal Bts juseyo💜 Unnie, Does " Jeo neun  Kimchi Joh-a-yo" mean I like Kimchi? I'm gonna keep coming back to this video till I master it minji..... I LOVE YOU THANK YOU. Wow, this video was made 6 years ago. It's great!

Thank you 🙂🙂 The things I do for NCT, Shinee & SuperM Please help to learn me Korean because I  really like to learn Korean and I like your teaching thank you I was so confused if 애 and 로 have the same meaning How do you learn the vocal inflections or does it matter? It sounds like Koreans are almost singing when they speak (especially the girls) and I’m so busy learning basic pronunciation that I’m not having the same tone 😂🥺 Please tell me meaning of jom ㅌin Korean is pronounced as t in english so plz tell me why you used  ㅅ in this and that thank you Now i know how to mix Kamsamnida eoni!Am i rigth?Nvm Salanghae! Why google translate and YouTube have a big different? I tried to translate it but wrong? I know how to read korean alphabet but i dunno the meaning 😁 I want to learn more korean to be fluent because when I was little my grandma and her friends spoke to me in korean but then my mom got married, we moved away and I completely forgot everything. Then coming back for the past 5 years I re-collected myself with my culture. So im happy I can finally get to understand my own language. The thing I do for blackpink As I watch many YouTube video to learn about Korean vocab, the teacher in the video will pronounce the word differently than other teacher I watch in other video when it the same word . Can anyone explain why or like different people have different pronounciation Thank you so much for this. You explain things very well and clear that it's easy to understand and remember.

한국어 적음 할수 있어요 😊Hello, guys! Thank you for watching my video! Hope this is helpful for you to practice Korean.
There is one thing I need to correct among the expressions in the video.

What's your name?
The translation of this expression in Korean is
이름이 뭐예요? (i-reu-mi-muh-"ye"-yo?) <- This is the right one.
이름이 뭐에요?(i-reu-mi-muh-"e"-yo) <- This is wrong. 
It is slightly different, but want to let you know grammatically right one. 

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for understanding. 
Have a nice day! :) Im learning this cause i want to understand BTS 나는 인디언이다

When you understand a korean word it is the best feeling like i was watching twice video they were done cooking and i heard “jal meokketsumnida“ i was like OMG I KNOW THAT WORD. it means Bon Appetite Hwating everyone! 
Borahae 💜💜💜💜 "I have become very interested in Korean culture after watching many K-dramas and TV shows my while life." Yep, I can relate to that 😅

Thanks for the tips ❤️ Dear BTS 


This is for YOU 🥰💜💜 Her: Learns korean because she likes Kdramas and korean culture 
Me: Learns korean because i want to understand BTSs V-Live Are you army
Because my reason for studying korean is there are no subs in bangtantv old videos Question. Is it easier to learn vocabulary faster through sentences or word for word??? After seeing her notes i thought that this is a book😅😅
Bcoz of her good handwriting!!!! i just wanna tell you that you are really good at hangul writing Hi! Learn Korean with me really helps me a lot. And I’d rather spend years learning Korean then doing one days worth of maths homework lol I only learn korean language because I am a BTS army It's so beautiful how you wanna learn our language! Lots of Love form Korea ❤️💜 Who is learning korean for bts Very impressive!!! But I cannot afford to use your method of studying. Perhaps you can try mind mapping techniques.🗺️🧠 Fantastic! Thanks for sharing I feel you are one of the most honest and genuine people who has given such wonderful tips on how to self-study Korean, simple crisp and straightforward . I PURPLE YOU :D Your notes are so good and well organised I'm learning korea so if i grow up I'll go to korea for my pre-debut and i picked my korean name as "Kim Ji woo" and if i got in korea I'll try doing audition as kpop idol and try my best to reach my dream. I am trying my best to learn Korean. Cause I love learning new languages I'm already in  level-3 and I agree it's a bit difficult language for native English speakers but I'm Asian and the grammer pattern, pronunciation are pretty much similar. Being a slow learner is the best you learn it so deeply. Keep it up. I'm learning Korean because  i wanna watch kdrama without subtitles.💜 UR 24?????
Girl, you look so young, ur super cute 8:54 wow! I used to watch Korean dramas with my mom as well and even before the person in the film used to speak I used to understand even though I'm not learning Korean right now because I'm mainly learning Chinese. I'll learn Korean from October to the end of the year though! 😁And yes, it is an amazing feeling to understand something in a target language!! ♥️ Thanks for sharing your tips, Ann! ppl who learn korean are BTS or kpop fan and ppl who learn Japanese are anime fan my only motivation is that it gets that itch in my brain. i find the way korean is written and spoken just hits my brain in just the right way lol thank you so much, this helped alot  i wanted to learn korean but i dint know how to start and what to do this helped alot I love it thank you for the tips and ideas !!!!!💜 This video make me very very motivated till tomorrow I want to give up but now I'm so insfire!!! actually i learn more Korean than my own school Oh wow I'm using talk to me Korean website I'm in lesson 7 How can I do all this with my studies.....I wanna learn Korean coz I hope to go there but I don't have enough time :(((( Thank you for sharing your tips Wow this kid is amazing!

Your english is too good!
Your writting is too beautiful
Your voice is too beautiful I just learn korean language for bts💜💜 watching videos about people learning Korean is so motivating I swear i want my notes to look nice like that but my handwriting is horrible 😩 Ur handwriting looks like a printed book ❤️❤️❤️wow I watch a lot of Kdrama Since 2019 and i Know how to speak korean For a little bit , and now I'm currently trying to Improve my Korean with learning From youtube . where can i learn korean Instead of youtube ? 🤍 Your handwriting is so clean.. i first thought it was a textbook Nice tips I want to learn Korean because I love kpop so I want to be able to understand my fav kpop stars 💜 i learned English and Korean at the same time

remember mark : prIVaCy JiGUeM But we dont have books in korean in our country😩 와 정말 대단해요.. 저는 영어를 이렇게 열심히 공부해야하는데…😅 I wanted to learn Korean because im a fan of K-pop. I also cant buy or order any textbooks but i will try to be more motivated my head: of course you will not be sitting in one place to study then what? omg! I just can't believe that you are a beginner.. your Korean handwriting is very beautiful like a master's handwriting... all the best:) i am only 14 and dont earn by myself . so i need a free online korean recommendation. can somebody recommend who else are here to learn korean for our bangtan boys bts.. army always.. My brain every times why do you study korean,go and study your school lesson.
But I studied hard &that one is-Anneyong-haseyo I want to learn korea bcs i want to go  stray kids fanmeeting and i want to speak korea for other member but for felix i just speak english Your notes look like a textbook that I would buy and study.  Very nice, neat, detailed, and cute stickers to help keep the focus.  <3 I learning Korean cause one day when I meet BTS JUNGKOOK I will be pro at speaking it and also cause I am interested in Korean culture 🇰🇷🇰🇷 i have been learning korean for a year now and i can understand sentences together in kdramas and understand most of the vlives...but i want to learn more of korean and it feels like i have come at a standstill with jus listening to its audio and learning through pinterest basics...or podcasts...i think i should also buy workbooks like thesee.....thx for all the tips i rely gotta keep a track of my vocablary in a book neatly maintained OMG 😱 I no that book it’s from a YouTubeber that book is from a YouTube channel! I just came here for BTS💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Thank you for sharing. Since now the school is done i will have so much time to learn korean💜😸 Me who didn't do anything in the 8 months of quarantine my country went through because I can't find any dictionary or book of the languages that i want to learn anyway : 😀 The apk named lingodeer is osm 💜💜 Sorry but is there any website I can’t really get those books right now A tip I learned in my way of learning Korean was not to watch Kdrama's sense their scripted and not the direct translations to what their trying to say(if that made any sense).
So I would totally recommend unscripted videos like vlogs and just in general un scripted Korean. kpop literally helped like it only took me months Me learning Korean,Japanese,Spanish at the same time 
My brain who is already struggling with exam preparation: aneyongolawjudvrhshdg 99 % here for k pop and BTS 
1% for fun Thank you so much for posting this. I too have started learning Korean just recently and I’m already so proud of myself with the progress I have made. I will be sure to check out some of the supplies you use. I have been wanting Korean learning books and those you have seen very helpful, so thank you😊🙌🏼I found Hangul very easy to learn, I still struggle with some of the characters, such as, “ㅛㅕㅑㅐㅔㅠㅝㅗ.” But I plan on making flash cards to help me remember❤️ Thanks you so much honestly 💗 You must be good in Korean now, ty for this video 🎥🐶 Thank you for everything ☺️☺️ .
This was useful for me , and your tips too , I like it "Why do you wanna learn Korean?"
I'm learning korean... but not for the same reason as most.
I started off watching Chinese dramas like 6 years ago and knew that Chinese was gonna be too hard... so I went with a European language. That didn't work out so I gave up trying. I still loved watching Chinese dramas tho. Well, there was a drama I saw where someone was speaking korean (now the actor speaking it sounds so unnatural), it sounded so cool. So I looked it up (Korean) and found k-dramas! I watched and listened. Then I decided I loved how the language sounded and wanted to try it out. From then on I fell in love with the whole culture! Although, there are some social standards and opinions that bother me in actual SKorean society... but the history and origins are fascinating! And I also fell into the K-pop hole... (I'm whipped for Namjoon of BTS, and Bangchan of Straykids. I like the leaders apparently😅)
Thank you for reading my experience. This was my explanation for learning Korean. 🇰🇷 "The korean word for today is..........*peeks*.... 오늘." I cracked up at that because the word of the day was today 🤣 (Good job tho! You tried to think of it for a good while before checking 👍) me: studies with the talktomeinkorean website
duolingo: *wAit A mINuTe* i really like learning languages and korean and japanese have been some of the hardest according to me but thank you for this :) YOUR NOTES OMG THEY ARE BE-AU-TIFUL HOLYYY YOURE A ROLEMODEL wish me the best cuz i am currently learning korean and spanish now! as a malaysian who really loves spain and korea, i know this will be worth it someday :) How the hell can someone write that neatly🙂🔫 her notes are looking like typed words..... just how😳 Me trying to learn Japanese and Korean

me after wards: one 30 min video took me 3 hr to complete that is it took 3 days because of making notes at the same time
( but still not gonna give up .....and jeeni teaches so flawlessly i have no excuse to give up .. this sucks) Me when she said we were gonna make a sentence 🥳🥳 jenny’s hair looks so soft Bless this woman, she's actually teaching us useful words we can actually use instead of just random vocab!!

1. So I can one day talk to BTS in Korean (never gonna happen but whatevs 😭😭)
2. To speak to Jisoo unnie from blackpink in Korean (again never gonna happen 😢)
3. TO FLEX ON MY FRIENDS Korean is as same as grammar in many ways and in the grammar it's totally same .. Learning korean slang is a bit hard but I can do this for bts I am here bcz of bts is "b" in the middle of a a word silently pronounce? It's easy for me I love to learn korean language its amazing I'm an Indian and I really want to learn Korean because of bts and kdrama but seriously it is very hard to learn Korean but I will try What if my name is not John smith😂😂 안녕하세요 이걸로 영어를 배워도 되겠군요 I am learning koreañ language only bcoz I am a bts army 'this is slow but fast😅 
its accurate when you say (3x repeated and basic... I know Korea by bts whenever Korea name comes their is only one thing come in my mind BTS before 8 month ago i listened Korean name 1st time Im practice this Learning only for bts!! i been in korean before because i am korean like i am so lucky is this is South Korean or North Korean??? 😂🤔plz help I can't understand any ARMYs here who want to join Bangtan Academy to learn Korean language?  💜 I am the one army here ??

Is it spelled differently than it sounds? Trying hard to learn korean language, for the love of BLACKPINK... 아시아 인이라면 한국어를 배우는 것은 그리 어렵지 않습니다. 일본어, 중국어, 태국어, 인도인이라면 쉽게 배울 수있을 것입니다 .... 행운을 빕니다. 👍 

Learning Korean is not that difficult if you are Asian. If you are Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Indian, you will be able to learn easily.... Good luck. It so hard to learn 😵😵😩😩 this would be my fourth langauge and its haaard, but really helpful and great video!!! It’s a very useful video but my problem is that I’m not from the USA Isn't that city in the background San Francisco? Korean is such a beautiful language 😍 and yes pronounciation is not hard at all for me cuz i am a native Hindi speaker (from India) Doesn't seem so slow to me ：（ I'm sure one day I'm gonna speak Korean like a native even though I'm a beginner 💪💪👊 I want sleep lol After I watch this video "annyeonghaseyo" is the only word that my brain recalls How do you know my name??!?🙄 😭😭 Ty Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 Nevermind 2:16 @_@ 제이름은 아리야 르미르 합니다 😊 whos mr white? im not john smith its so hard to pronounce Ohh such a nice and long video 👍😃 My goal is to learn the first 1 minute off the top of my head and then the next one minute and maybe the next 2 minutes WHO KNOWS😁 setting small obtainable goals🌟 its not hard love it one problem from video my name is suman not John Smith practising this cuz i wanna be a kpop idol someday!

It's amazing. Even she repeated ths sentences in korean still she say it faster.. Please, can you make her to say it slowly by  eavh words? Thank you, sje should pronounce every sentence. She goes faster. Korean she speaks fast in koream, if she could say it rry slowly because, reafing the writing korean it isn't that quick to read. I coykd even followed her sound to speak in korwan language.. Very fast. Its easy to learn the language of korean but its hard to learn the hanggul.But keri lng this is for bts and bp😁 I wish I could go to Korean and learn the language.. But unfortunately I don't know how to do that and how I can find a job there Good too fast,, 조금 천천히 말해주시겠습니까 I chocked when she said I didn’t catch that 아네온가쇼 (Hi) Coming back from my French lessons 😂 Hello I'm confused about kamsahamnida and gamsahabnida can u guys help me<3 I think the pace is great bc if you want to become fluent you have to learn to say things at a normal pace 그걸 눈치채지 못했는데요.. 다시 한번 말해도 돼요?

JUNGKOOKIE DON'T WORRY I'M COMING Only Korean phrase I know:

I'm here for the return of Superman... 😅 not k-pop. Im going to Korea for a 2 week camp and likeee I only know how to say “hello” 당신 Is very provocative please avoid using it guys For BTS❤ 감 사 합 니 다.❤️❤️❤️❤️ Some of this is pronounced incorrectly:( i’m here bc of three things: 
1) kpop 
2) kdramas 
3) i like the language Bts im coming we can talk now 😍😍😍 Taehyung I’m coming 😂 All i have to say is tysm, this rlly helped.





Also everyone whos saying (insert bts member name in all caps) IM COMING FOR YOU is creepy pls stop Bookmark: 6:58 Just want to learn korean so i can ask Tzuyu "will you marry me?" and then have a *little conversation* after she rejects me. Lmao tjis actually helped alot!! Jalja ~~ I think she forgot to include annyeonghi jumoseyo which mean goodmorning tip:
watch kdramas (keep your ears all the sentences they are saying)
color coded videos (kpop)
and lastly, if u can read hangul already but still need some improvements, try watching some comeback shows that have korean lyrics at the left side corner of the screen so that u can read it. its difficult at first trying to catch up with the words but bear with me.  

P.S
im just giving some tips because it worked for me. no hates. ^ ^ oof *Watch out Seoul I'm coming* XD SUGA im coming..........oh wait I don't have enough money to come in korean I forgot 😂😅😅😅 We are going to take over the world of kpop 😂😂😂😂 The amount that we are all deluded as ARMY to the point that we are learning korean lol im not gonna meet bts so why am i learning korean i wouldnt even go to a fan meet because they are intimidatingly handsome to the point i would cry if eye contact was made \(^_^)/ so sad It’s really really really really really really helpful thank you very much

Glad you enjoyed and found this video helpful 🙏🏼 Pls also share this vid w/ your family and friends who want to learn Korean. I will also do videos na basic & helpful Korean phrases mga puro bad words ganun. 😂 Abangan nyo haaa! Labyuuu 😘 EXO lang naman yung dahilan eh reason why i want to learn korean:
— to easily sang kpop songs Why I want to learn korea:
1.BTS
2.Fan sign meeting
3.vlive I wanna learn cuz I kinda get inspired by those who learn Korean/japanese in vrchat 😂 5:15 me wanting to learn korean because the bottom right (ITZYYY) Heyyy 99.99.99% people watching this is a kpop fan or a BTS fans ANu uung title ng openging song Im not even filipino or either korean but im here Gomawo When you're learning Korean but you watch too much Japanese content(anime)... Napapansinin ko nlng pagsinusubukan kong magsalita ng Korean ay nahahaluan nlng bigla ng japanese , but thank you for making this video I will definitely take note of these tips and I will study hard to learn Korean, Hwaiting! Thank you so much 😊 RATHER USE PAPAGO THAN GOOGLE TRANSLATE😁 5:17 sanaol may IU saka ITZY sa background kailangan ko to para mapansin sa weverse, ayaw ko na umasa sa google translate lol Thank you po sa knowledge na binigay niyo .. pero try rin po natin yung baybayin The problem with not telling people u speak a certain language and/or know it even if u claim that ur better than others is that letter a. No one would care about u learning cause u don’t tell them and b. You will not get the practice u need. Language is a two way learning process it requires internal preparation and multiple feedbacks from people who are proficient speakers, whatever level they are, of the said language. Not telling people that you speak a language robs u the opportunity of practicing speech and colloquialisms, understanding a language is different from speaking it. Alam natin to sa pinas example dami nakakaintindi ng ingles pero yung mga nakakasalita ln ng straight na ingles ay ung mga magaling sumagot sa clase nung sa school pa and mga natututo dahil May kaya sila and/or English speaking sila sa bahay. Kung puro ka basa ln ng English at pakikinig ln ng English mahihirapan kang magstitch ng conversational English ng walang putol. That’s why as a tip to ur viewers always tell native speakers that ur learning the language and ask them if they can help you practice, it’d be great. I know that the problem is madami satin nahihiya and natatakot magkamali or pagtawanan pagmaymali. We should stop thinking like this as language learners because it’s only when we make these mistakes do we truly understand the language and learn from it to sharpen our skill better. Good luck to your viewers.

Also I teuida is pronounced 트이다 or 테위다 I'm not sure I see a lot of people saying they’re learning Korean to understand K-pop idols and watch K-dramas without subtitles, i understand because i also listen to K-pop and watch K-dramas but i personally want to learn Korean because of the Korean culture and because the Korean language sounds so elegant, i love it. Kdrama:70%
BTS:0%
Show off:100% I am using duilingo for over 1 year i want to use a app for korean grammar but i dont know what If I do as much as you have downloaded the app, then my mobile will explode I have a question, do you know any  apps that include books and stories in Korean for beginners.

I wanted to start studying for TOPIK so I downloaded many many apps that would be helpful, but it happened that when I was reading, I read it slowly so it was difficult to understand what I was reading and I thought I am not capable of giving this test. But today when I watched your video, I understood that I was able to understand 75% of the thing you said (which when I read myself I didn't interpreted it🤦🏻‍♀️).
So now I know what to do for my improvement  because of you🙏. I am very grateful to you, because of you I realized what are the things that I require to improve myself in korean.
Please keep making more of such videos and helping us out and saving many lives🙏. You're teaching is very effective for me and I really appreciate your efforts.🙏.
Thank you!

I do wish that the vocab words were in dictionary form instead though, that way an explanation of grammar can come in a separate lesson. the "Excuse me how much is this?" is from jimin be honest or at least who all thought that 99.9 percent of viewers r here to learn Korean language for bts😂🤣 I'm not learning for bts or kdrama. I'm learning Korean language because i want to be a kpop so I'm learning Korean language. 💜 WHO is STRAY KIDS STAY? This was very helpful. Thank you! 고마워요! Do I have a hearing problem?

It is very easy to pronounce by the help of the video
I will totally recommend this video to everyone Thanks Abby! I always found it difficult to differentiate between the d and the t sound, as well as the p and the b. It makes so much sense now afyer watching your video. I saw you promote Lingoda in your other video but that program doesn't teach Korean. Is there any program you would recommend for learning Korean? Thanks in advance! Thank you for adding Arabic translation 🙏❤️ I think for indians hanguel is little bit easy to pronounce because we have variety of hindi alphabets which is simialar to hanguel alphabets Being Scottish and trying to speak other languages is hard lmao U r quite funny😅😅but a good teacher💜 0:20 0.20 0:19 You can say whatever koreans probalbemrej understands you It's 1:13am here and i got a sudden urge to learn how to pronounce korean cause why not This video is so helpful!

I wanna die Oh my gosh why Korean in so hard like this
How can I pronounce 네
Not N and not D
I will give up🚶‍♀️ Me watching this and going "hahahaha" while getting home from an exam, which was a total disaster 😂 You look like Jeon Hyebin.. or are you Jeon Hyebin? Why can't we depend on English Romanization? Ok so i wasnt wrong...i wasnt hearung thing...i was so confused of whether 'yes' is korean is "ne" or "de" or sometimes i even heard "ye"....i always used to hear differently everyyy timeee

Also i used to think they are saying "imnida"...then i realized its "ibnida"...so i wasnt completely wrong.... This is a nice tutorial. I am looking forward to more of this kind of videos! thank you! amazing stuff I can’t count how many times I have referred back to this video to help with proper pronunciation. I’m 2 weeks into learning Korean and your video is definitely helping me along tremendously. All I wanted was learn kanji how did I ended up here?! 네 Sounds like ne, 라 sounds like la, 가 sounds like ka, 다 sounds like ta and 바 sounds like pa. 그리고 솔직히 한국인이지만

Literally learning from my mistakes hahaha I'm here to learn Korean for BTS😑 my tongue hurts after endless practice with this word "진짜" made me think about how much our mouth posture affects how we pronounce words, awesome video please. i cannot get the difference between k and g.

I HOPE SO It's silly as I follow along. Your teaching is great. I have thoughts of words that go with them but that's just a few of people and your teaching is a good foundation. With out the use of slang.... 😂 Ya Gka Kah Gga

Im not sure if im right but it is easier this way. Im just a beginner tho. But this is how i do it. 😂 Her: 안녕하세요
Me:æñohisheyo Im here bc of bts lmaoo How do u tell the difference between 타 and 자 I recommend the korean pronuciation lite app it shows you the sound and the way the tongue is supposed to move Im just trying to make a korean utau..... How to call your friend in 한 글  7:51 Im trying to learn Korean so that I can understand anime THIS WAS SO SO HELPFUL THANK U!!! Up down made me laugh quite heartily. Thanks for that! Team Taehyung anyone? you sound like Akwafina. Ok bts be grateful doing this for you guys.. Jinjja yo.. I am glad that spanish is my native language, it makes so easy to learn new pronunciations I see a lot of comments from people that is learning Korean because they want to watch k-dramas without reading subtitles, to understand their idols interviews or to visit Korea... and I am here just tasting the waters because I got stuck in level B2 of English language and don't know what else to do to spend my time in this eternal quarantine This is so incredibly helpful thank you! Btw whoever sees this JESUS loves ya! GOD bless ya! John 3:16!💜 Suffering for BTS who dont even know i exist 💜 I like south Korea because blackpink is here❤️🙈🙈🙈 I'm quite comfortable with my pronunciation but I still cannot get ㄷ/ㅌ ㅂ/ㅍ ㄱ/ㅋ
Idk why. It just sounds the same to me xD
It's the same in English were I couldn't hear the difference between w and r. White and right just sounded the same to me until like a year ago when I finally learned to differentiate them. (and I don't think I will ever master the th sound, but that's another story...) 这个姑娘不错 （韩国人能看懂吗？） I'm a korean, and I totally agree with this. People should not rely on romanization. It is really unnatural in pronounciation. Also, your korean pronounciation is really good! I think you were the best in pronounciation among foreigners. Thank you for this video! You explained the vowel sounds much more clearly than other videos I've seen 😄 Thank you so much i was really looking for something like this so that i can learn korean conveniently ❤️❤️❤️ good teacher fr I can't be the only one trying to learn better pronunciation because they about to hit up karaoke with their friends and sing blackpink all night... SO helpful. Thank you! I speak conversational Japanese and I recognize some of the similarities in some of the dental d's and t's. But there are so many more varieties here!! Time to study! i think for russians the 으 aka eu sound is easier, because they have something similar, ы, but i'm still not sure, becayse am just a beginner and i noticed that everyone pronounces everything in a different way, oof TT anyone else want to move to south korea?- But it's a bit hard Thank you very much.. This help a lot This is great. Thanks for breaking this down. I knew most of these facts but it's nice hearing them repeated and then hearing them being pronounced immediately after. I like how much you focus on the physical act of producing the sound as well, that's one of my favorite things about learning a new language. I first thought that she was teaching hindi 😛
So, sorry Mam 😁😁 Thank you, Abby, wonderful video! I've just started learning Korean and this will be an excellent resource. You're so pretty, and I thought you were Jeon Hye-Bin when I first saw the thumbnail! Ow my good thaku How come does an American-Filipina pronounce Korean this good??? Her Korean pronunciation is literally better than mine. I can't pronounce proper ㄹ sound because my tongue is thick and short like a turtle's head. That sucks. I can't properly pronounce 'R' sound too. Hi I'm learning Korean but u also tell the meanings of words Your face looks so familiar for me Thank you! Knowing where my tongue should be and seeing your mouth helped a ton! I sound wayyy better than when I was using romanizations, now I sound less like an American and more like a native... hopefully lol Great video. As a Korean, I couldn't understand that ㄱ and ㅋ are confused, other consonants as well. But after I watched this video, I realized what was difficult to them. Your explanation of pronounciation is VERY accurate and analytic. If someone around me studies Korean, I'll fully recommend this video. 3:03 
the [oo] in "look" or "book"
(edit: combined with the [i] sound in "sit" or "mitt" Is anyone going to talk about how soothing her voice is? Y’all realize why she didn’t put the translation on 바보 😆 Jimini pa bo 🙂 Annueonghaseyo IT TOOK ME 3 HOURS NOW ITS TIME TO DO SUGA RAPPP LET,DO IT pronounce ㄹ like the 'dd' in 'ladder'!

Is there any difference between 1- hana ,1- il  or 2- dul , 2-i , is there any rule for using these cus both are 1 but with different names , so that is little confusing for me . If anyone can explain this then please .

I can read hangul, write hangul and already know abt making grammar but the only thing I must learn is learning Korean vocabulary. help...... I don’t know how I am gonna remember all this hello ١
بينما تبث كلمة الطبيعة في النفس انطباعًا بالثبات وعدم التغيّر، يظهر الإنسان عمومًا، والإنسان المعاصر بخاصة، كائنًا تاريخيًا ومتغيرًا، تغيّراته متسارعة في زمننا. فهل يمكن القول إن الإنسان ينفرد عن بقية الأحياء بأنه ليس له طبيعة، أو أن كل تصور للطبيعة الإنسانية هو تصور تاريخي، يدين لزمنه أكثر مما يدين لما يُفترض أنها جِبِلّتنا أو تكويننا الثابت؟ وحين ننظر حولنا نرى أن شركاءنا في الحياة من حيوانات ونباتات يبدون مبرمجين على الأفعال والتفاعلات نفسها طوال حياتهم، خلافًا لنا. ليس للسناجب تاريخ، فهي تفعل الأشياء نفسها كل عام في دورة... طبيعية. للسنجاب طبيعة، وإن كنا لا نعرف ماذا يدور في رأس السنجاب، وماذا يعني كون الحيّ سنجابًا. للإنسان تاريخ بالمقابل، ويبدو أن لنا تاريخًا لأنه ليس لنا طبيعة. 

لكن يبدو القول إنه ليس للإنسان طبيعة واضحَ البطلان. فنحن نتوزع على جنسين، ونتكاثر بالتوالد، ويرضع الصغار منا حليب الأمهات، ويلزمنا عام وأكثر كي نستطيع المشي، نمشي على ساقين مثل الطيور لكن لا نطير مثلها، وإن لم نمت بحادث أو بقتل بعضنا لبعضنا، فنحن نموت موتًا «طبيعيًا»  في سن الشيخوخة، ويندر أن يعيش الواحد أو الواحدة منا قرنًا. لكننا نتكلم بعد عامين أو ثلاثة، منفردين عن غيرنا من الحيوانات باللغة. ورغم تعدد لغاتنا فإنه ليس بيننا من هم بلا لغة، ويمكن لمتكلم أي لغة أن يتكاثر بالتزاوج من متكلمة أي لغة أخرى، ما يعني أننا بيولوجيًا متماثلون، أي لنا «طبيعة» واحدة. وهذا مهم ضد «العنصريين» من بني البشر. فهم ينكرون الوحدة الطبيعية للبشر، أي وحدة العنصر البشري، بل يقررون كثرة العناصر البشرية وتراتبها كمعطيات ثابتة، أي طبيعية. الواقع أن مفهوم الطبيعة الذي يمكن أن يُستند إليه لدحض الدعاوى العنصرية، يمكن الاستناد إليه كذلك للدفاع عنها. 

ثم أن الإنسان نتاج تطوّري لحياة على كوكب الأرض عمرها نحو أربعة مليارات عام، ما يعني أن التميّز المحتمل لطبيعته هو من احتمالات هذه الحياة، عبر عملية «انتخاب طبيعي» يفوز فيها الأفضل تأهيلًا والأقدر على توريث أفضلياته، ويخرج من السباق الأضعف تأهيلًا. وبهذه الصور يكون ما يبدو أنه يخرجنا من الطبيعة من تميّزٍ هو ذاته من معطيات الطبيعية.  

 

٢
يبدو أن تكويننا الحالي ثابت منذ مئات ألوف السنين وأكثر، وأننا مررنا قبل ملايين السنين بمراحل انتصبت خلالها قامتنا واتسعت جماجمنا، وأخذنا نُرمِّز ونصنع الأدوات. 

ومنذ ألوف السنين يبدو تاريخنا هو تاريخ ما نفعل ونستحدث، وليس تاريخ تطور طبيعي، مثل تطورنا في أزمنة موغلة في القدم. فهل يكون هذا فاصلًا قصيرًا، يفضي بنا إلى شيء بعده؟ وبعد ألوف أو عشرات ألوف السنين، هل يحتمل أن يُنظر إلى قدراتنا اليوم، وفي أساسها اللغة والفكر، كميّزات تطورية طبيعية، أفضت إلى دمار واسع للكوكب، وربما إلى حذف الكائن الذي حاز تلك الميزات واستعادة الكوكب والحياة عليه عافيتهما؟ سنكون عندها احتمالًا من احتمالات الطبيعة، دمر نفسه بنفسه وفقًا لما يمكن أن يُسمّى مبدأ مكر الطبيعية. لا يبدو هذا مستبعدًا كليًا. وقد لا يحدث الأمر بفعل القنبلة النووية، بل ربما القنبلة الجينية، التدخل في السجّل الوراثي البشري، أي في «طبيعة» الإنسان على نحو ينتج طبائع مختلفة أو «عناصر»، يقارب الفرق بينها الفرق بيننا وبين الشمبانزي مثلًا، وقد يمتنع التزاوج والتكاثر عند الوصول إلى هذه العتبة. بعبارة أخرى، قد تكون العنصرية الحقيقية أمامنا، سواء عبر تصنيع بشر للخدمة لا يتمردون ولا يعترضون، عبيدًا في طبيعتهم، كأنما هم حيوانات أليفة نافعة، يزيدها نفعًا أنها تتكلم وتعقِل؛ أو عبر إنتاج بشر خارقين يستخدموننا، نحن العاديين، كعبيد لهم، ويرون فينا مزاحمة لهم على الكوكب ولا بأس بقتل مئات الملايين أو المليارات منا، ولعلّهم في هذا يتسلّحون بقوة وقدرات لا قِبَلَ لنا بمواجهتها. 

 

٣
هذا يعيدنا إلى السؤال عن طبيعية الإنسان: ما تكون طبيعة الكائن الحي الذي يبدو قادرًا على تغيير طبيعته؟ هل يبقى مفهوم الطبيعة صالحًا حين يبدو غير ممتنع أن يغيرها مطبوعون مفترضون بها؟ أن يصنعوا طبائع جديدة لأنفسهم أو لغيرهم؟ حين تكون للكائن الحي طبائع بدل طبيعة واحدة؟ أو حين يُحتمَل أن يتميز إلى كائنات، لكلٍّ منها طبيعتها؟ تُحيل تغيُّريّة الإنسان إلى «العقل» كوليد للغة (التكلم مع الغير، والنفس، عن العالم)، وكنتاج تطوري اجتماعي. تطورت هذه القدرة تاريخيًا، وقبل قرون قليلة فحسب طرحت على نفسها إمكانية «السيادة» على الطبيعة و«تملّكها». تحققت تقدمات «سيادية» على مستويات محددة، لكن ثمنها كان باهظًا كما تقدَّم: انقراض شركاء أحياء كثيرين لنا، وتسخُّن الكوكب، وتهديد الحياة عليه، فضلًا عن أشكال تمييز فادحة بين البشر أنفسهم، منها إبادة واسعة النطاق للسكان الأصليين في قارتين على يد المسيطرين الأوروبيين، ومنها عبودية تجارية عابرة للقارات، عانى منها السود أكثر من غيرهم. وهذا في الوقت الذي سُمعت فيه مدركات مثل الإنسان وحقوقه والإنسانية أكثر من أي وقت سبق.   

فهل يحتمل أننا نتساءل اليوم عن طبيعة الإنسان لأننا نلمس شيئاً غير طبيعي في أنفسنا، مهدِّد للطبيعة التي ننحدر منها؟ 

ما هو هذا الشيء غير الطبيعي؟ لعله قدرة خاصة لدماغنا وجهازنا العصبي، متشكّلة تطوريًا (توسّع الجمجمة وانتصاب القائمة) واجتماعيًا (عبر اللغة وتشكل جماعات أوسع) على تعقّل الكائنات الأخرى وتعقيلها، و«اعتقال»ـها، بما في ذلك بعض البشر أو كثيرون منهم أو أكثرهم، هي ما نسميها العقل. الإنسان «حيوان ناطق» بمعنى عاقل. ولعل الإنسان الاجتماعي اخترع الثقافات والأديان أو طوّرها من باب «عقل» نفسه بالذات، ومنها بصورة خاصة جهازه العصبي النامي القلق. أنتج الإنسان الاجتماعي هذه العقائد والقواعد، أو «الثقافة»، كي تكون عقلًا خارجيًا له يضبط عقله الداخلي المهتاج، يعطيه عادات وتقاليد، مسالك تكرارية تساعده على أن تكون له طبيعة قارّة، أو تعوضه عن فقدان حيوانيته. ضربٌ من «معتقل» لهذا الكائن الفالت، غير الطبيعي. I'm learning Korean only for ♥️North Korea♥️anyone else who is also learning Korean for ✨KimJongUn✨ Same same.. 😬😬I GUESS I'm not ALONE.. 😆😆 Front size could be bigger in the video If afternoon ends in "t" wouldn't it be 대낱, not 대낮? Those of us that wrote down all 200 words and are now tired in korean😫 ★How to learn Korean fast!★
1. Listen to the pronunciation of Koreans and read the sentences aloud several times.
(It's better to read quickly.)

2. Read the 100 Korean words  a day. Don't try to memorize them. Just read along. Just refer to the examples. It's important to do 100 each a day.

3. After watching your favorite Korean video (drama), don't look at the screen and just listen to the sound several times.

4. After studying Korean on YouTube, write comments in Korean. (You have to talk a lot in Korean to improve your Korean language quickly. ^^)

Zero yeong Thanks for sharing. Is good if the wording can at least take up at least 60% of the space for presentation purpose. I appreciated this but it would be better if they used one voice over for hangul trans. When you know some words but you can't spell it in Hangul 😂 Spelling in Hangul is difficult 😂😅 Most of them are konglish words I wish the words were spelled like they sound. Sounded like the B's were P's and what not. Makes it confusing. Now I can identify some words in kdrama literally just1%of them😂😂 고맙습니다 i can read hangul,i hust dont understand what I'm saying haha I learned very fast korean with dramas and apps. Omg amazing.😄😃. I really recommended. I am going to teach korean in my channel.😍😍😍😄 P 2:15 I would learn more Korean language👄💬 Lmfao the second word is air conditioner aka air con and it’s eekeon which is air con with out the r i dont watch k drama or kpop but i wanna learn korean to read webtoon lol (so i dont have to buy fastpass cuz i have no money) 6:27 3:15 so if you know the numbers in korean (sino korean numbers) you already know the months .

Are these phrases you can ask anyone Friend or not 준비해 줄 수 있어요 Are you afraid of number 4?? Idk quarantine makes me learn my primary language from the beginning Something I noticed-  the numbers in this video are sino-korean, not native korean.

In the sigsa on the lunch part what does that mean? I'm a Korean guy and I thank you all for loving our culture 😍😊 I will love all of your cultures as well😌😌👍👍 The things I do for Bts 😳😳😳🤫 I just want to know what BTS says during vlives 😞 Can i ask how to know if we should use  ㅐ or ㅔ ???whats the difference Can I please have a study buddy.😊 Bro.💀 And people say English is hard. Korean has hundreds of words that mean the same thing but are pronounced differently and has a certain formal way to use each of them.💀 English has the same thing but usually it’s stuff like the different meanings of mean not stuff like different ways to say 1 2 3.💀💀💀 In this video one was " il " 일 but I've heard it like " hana " . Can someone explain me please ? Why does abeoji sound like Abbu ji in urdu I'm a simple man, this easily makes me laugh 5:41Hello!

There are exclusive Early Bird benefits prepared for our supporters  Thanks & see you soon See class details İn India (mumbai) aai means mom😂 Kamsa hamnida seongseng nim Ma'am can u tell me how many letters are there in Korean language ? Jennie... They have shooted this video when BTS was not introduced and now I am introducing myself to Korean I know this doesn't help much, but ㅡ sounds really similar to " î " in Romanian, I might still have a chance pronouncing it, lol. Such a great lesson and such an amazing teacher, can't wait to finish all the videos! Thank you so much for you effort! 감사합니다 ! A funny question...plz replay...
Mam.. are you in BTS army? Now i know Kamsamnida Is there a PDF format, I have to download it nice teaching It's too difficult to pronounce 😫 Annyeonghaseyo kamsahamnida love from india 🇮🇳🙏😍it's so easy to learn Korean thank you so much 🙏👌 Komawo Very useful Any one learning for bts i really get confused with the eo , o and u especially the eo and o really sound the same 감사합니다 Ok but i have a question How can i do phrases ? Just using that? Because i know the consonant and vowel etc and now what i have to do to understand the koreans? i love jenny "O" at the end has sound of "an" or "ang"? plz can anyone clear this query 익 Yok the station who else knows the sounds and can say korean words perfectly but has no idea what they mean in english? Here to learn Korean for bts.. Best video. Short and clear. 0:42 what she wrote on board, and what my keyboard writes 한 are both of these same? Most of Korean vowels like gujrati vowels and also like hindi vowels 
Nd hindi nd gujrati is indian language I like Ms. Jenny most. You're very good at explaining. The use of simple language, the way you repeat everything you say and that you give the learners examples where they can find the word context-based make it fairly easy to understand you.
Thank you very much (: I can understand stand more Korean by her more then my old math👀 You’re a great teacher!  I like the way you break down the lesson; very logical to follow and absorb. Thank you! This is 2012 video

Super useful. Many thanks for making this 🙏🏻
Fun fact: I’ve been studying Korean on and off for a couple of years… never made a significant progress although it seems I can read correctly it most of the times. I pause the video before each word try to guess then check with your pronounce. I’m still in love with it 😻 I learned Persian and Korean in just one year. With a lot of practice and also a lot of interest in these languages, especially Persian was very sweet for me 감사함니다  누나😊💕(저는 인도🇮🇳 임니다😊) 저는 한국인인데 이것을 왜 보고 있습니까? 🤣🤣 I can read all words easily but not really fast 감사함니다 친구 Thanks for making this video!

I could easily remeber it😂😂 Okay okay fine fine so SOUND IS 'SORRY' in Korean pronounciation😅😅 Hello can I ask a question? I'm wondering  the ㅇ is silent right so that does mean that I'm not gonna pronounce it? 3:46 안녕하세요? 한국인이 영어에 능통한지 알고 싶습니까? 이모는 한국에 가야합니다. 그러나 그녀는 유창하지 않습니다.

제 이모가 한국인이고 영어를 잘 할 수 있다는 뜻입니다. 한국인이 유창한 지 영어 과목이 있는지 물어보고 싶습니까?

0:23 the informal, friendly form is "annyeong." "Annyeonghaseyo" is not formal persay, just a little more polite.
0:46 the romanized version, "hana dul ses" is just a LITTLE off-- it'd be more like "hana dul set" because when the bottom of a syllable ends in ㅅ, it makes a "t" sound, even though ㅅ usually makes an "s" sound. 
2:19 "Gi-yeop-da" is a very informal, kind of quirky, cute-sy way of saying cute, or for saying that/it is cute. "Gee-o-woh-yo" is like saying "that/you/whatever is cute," and is kind of the standard for of saying it. "gee-o-woh" is more informal than "gee-o-woh-yo," but they're pretty much interchangeable. 
2:59 "saranghaeyo" is also another way of saying I love you, but it's more formal. 
4:02 "pali" should probably be romanized as "bali." 
(Two ㅂ's make a B sound, one makes halfway between a B and a P, and then ㅍ makes a soft P sound.)


This was all too much information, but whatever. Seeing this video makes my half Korean ass happy :D If you are curious about Korean in the video of the 'Permission to Dance' MV Shooting Sketch?
Let's study Korean together while watching BTS videos!

 Peace! i am here to get rid of the " i dont understand what they are saying but lets laugh" I love bts Sooooo funy video 😂 Who is here for learning korean with BTS?                                                           Me😇💜💜💜 ❤️ Am not running after  BTS people say that  bts like black pink peace out Am making a bts girl kids group hope I meet bts thank so much bts Didn’t know “Sorry”was a long word but thank you~ 2:43 and starting of this ohhhhhhhhhhh!! Was amajing....... I want to learn so bad.  But,  having visual processing deficiet makes it so hard!  I can barely remember the English I read...💔.  I won't quit though!! After seeing bts I can't stop saying "aish, jinja, haJIMA, chotto MATTE, and pabo" 🥺👉👈😂💕 This is funny : I was curious about what the Korean word for poodle might be, and the online translator said,"pudeul"! Is it pronounced the same? It never occurred to me there would be any overlap between the two, as there often is with European languages. 👍👍👍👍 3:00 so cute 🥺🥺🥺 lol this is like the koreaboo ver. This is awesome. I’ve heard the words but not see the romanisation or Hangul so I was lost. You’ve made it easy to understand. Thank you This is real bts channel I am learning Korean now only for BTS. How many ARMIES are learning Korean for BTS?

BTS FOREVER 💜💜💜!!! From rm I learned that 비 (bi) means rain. Thank you so much this helped me ! 
I have subscribed jin english is really good. Maybe someone already adressed it but its "hana dul set" since an ㅅ at the end of a syllable will be pronounced as a t, Koreans dont use any sharp s in the end like Bus, written as 버스 , will sound sth like "Beosu" I dont know romanisation to well since I went right away for learning the sounds of Hangul ^^ I just started learning hangul bout 3 weeks ago and didnt rly take it that srs but still I managed to learn this I recomment ppl that want to understand written and spoken hangul to learn it with Hangul not romanisation ^^ dont we all only want to understand them on Vlive in the end of the day ;P

I rly like videos like this since you hear it in a everyday scenario  :) I saw many taekook moments here it was so fun Thank you for making this video ❤️ Big fan me today call jimin  and talk about this channel ☺☺ I like Korean culture mostly. But what is BTS. Thank u for this video Bts their my real teachers my korean language improved This is super cool!여러분 오늘도 TTMIK 채널 방문해 주셔서 감사합니다! Thank you for tuning in again today everyone! 
You can add this free course to your learning center here: https://talktomeinkorean.com/products/detail/97 Twice and Blackpink I wish i could ever learn korean and visit there once before i die.
Love from india 🇮🇳 BTS trying to learn English for us.we are trying to learn korean for them💜💜💜 Actually I know some of the above phrases through k-dramas^_^

Okay but when you use those words and phrases while trying to talk with Korean peps and when you get a reply from them ...you be like🙁😶mwo😂and that "you" is literally me hoping that I'll get a chance to work in Korea after completing my studies Idk whether it'll come true or not 😂 anyways I'm so much into k-dramas and k-pop that makes me want to learn Korean 😊 감사합니다 😃 Thank you for the work - if I could offer a suggestion it would be for a phonetic spelling in English to be shown, it can be awkward for me with the differences in accent to determine the sounds of similar letters. Because bighit/hybe doesn’t always provide subtitles! Can someone please explain to me why the m at the beginning sound like b? That confuses me a lot like for example 뭐 해 in the video. This is missing the transliterated pronouncing in English I feel like I'm missing out on deep feels when I'm listening to korean music so here I am Thank you Working in a cafe with mostly Korean employees, and at the same time, I haven't decides on either Chinese, Japanese, or Korean for my grad school concentration. As a kid, I've always been made fun of trying to learn Korean but this video is giving me some confidence. The fact that I'm here although I know all of these in this video. Much better if u put a English sub, in korean that's why beginners easy to read, coz they don't read hangul I'm on book 5 but still need to review I'm finally in Korea! I landed yesterday. Thanks it was really helpful! I got into an Everglow fancall and want to learn some Korean phrases for the girls :) It will be more easy to pronunciation if there will be English subtitles included there . I'm wanted to learn one Korean phrase everyday (so I can remember it well). I already knew some of it but on my notes today is 수고하세요 . Is anyone just watching this and writing stuff down, just because like, I swear I be doing the weirdest stuff when I'm bored well, at least now I know how to speak Korean, if I meet a Korean person I guess 😃 안녕하세요 ㅇ나녕 i just tried practicing the casual hi hello. i got the last bit right but can anyone help me type the phrases in this video please? มรว.จูยอนปาร์คอะฮ๊ากอะฮ๊ากมากด้วยรัก 🙂 This is such a great resource for English speaking teachers with students who speak Korean at home. Thank you for making this video. 감사합니다❤️ Ive noticed Korean speaking English is Very polite clean and the pronounciation is perfect comparing to western no offense 😅 my parents wanna visit Korea so I might as well become google translate 💜💜💜💜 i liked the vdo a lot ! thanks for ur hard work   :) this video has helped me so much!! thank you!!! :) i have a question! so if you are supposed to speak formal to people that are older than you and people you dont know well, do you still have to speak formal to somebody older than you but you are still close to them? for example your best friend, if they are older than you do you still have to speak formal to them? i like this video <3 well done guys! I'm learning Korean only for ♥️North Korea♥️anyone else who is also learning Korean for ✨KimJongUn✨ TBH I think I need someone so like we can practice together because I feel like I’m not really improving Korean dramas helped me with the pronunciation U must write the pronunciation in English also..so we can pronounce it easily ☹️ Meu Deus, desisto. Thank you do you know any reality show to learn korean like namjoon learned using friends Me learning korean so I dont have to read the subtitles to K-dramas🙄✋🏽 How can i get the book! 감사합니다 "Your two best friends are dating each other and you had no idea", I didn't say 대박 though it was more of 어떻게 감히 lololol Thanks for the video :-) Excuse me = Chokiyo
Me : Yaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!! We cannot read Korean writings pls translate in english. 👎 doesn't "시간 있어요 ?" also means "do you have time" in formal Idk if this is harder or Spanish! 😭🙏🏼 I love Korean language!! The  “What Should We Eat” is so hard for me 😭 If Namjoon oppa can do than i can to!!!!! Why in the sentence  내일 봐 it becomes  봬 when we add 요? Is it wrong to write  봐요? Other phrases are familliar for me because i watch kdrama a lot and some are familiar😊😊 Nice 👍 What is God in Korean? here because of bts and i genuinely want to learn korean lol I am learning Korean, because I feel like I love Korean culture more than Western Culture. I want to study korean & i like to talk with my idols bts🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷 wait a minuite for sorry, its supposed to be mianhae but why does it sounds like bianhae hhmm Dear BTS,

This is for you

💜 Your English is satisfying Can you explain to me this phrase 미처 그 생각을 the phrase is not complete but I want you to explain it to me 良い,come from china Today is the National Korean SAT day. I wanted to say something to cheer my friend on but I didn’t know what to say that would really have an impact. After this video I know what to say. Thank you 😊 you understand you watched too many korean dramas and follow kpop for almost 12 years when you know all of these phrases :| XD i guess i can learn korean in a shorter time now. let's start! 고마워 수고하세요- keep up the good work (formal)
수고 = efforts, hard work
*used when you’re leaving and the other person stays to work
수고하셨습니다- thank you for your hard work (formal)
also can mean : good job, good work
당연하지 - of course (casual)
당연하죠- of course (formal) jooyeon so smart and pretty The ad was amazing I couldn't skip that because that's the song by BTS*life goes on* Thanks. Accept is pronounced with a K. aKsept. Thank you for the lesson! This might be the wrong place to ask but what`s really the difference between 좋아 and 좋네? What is the difference between meogeulkkayo and meogeulkeoya? I guess I am the only person here who isn't gonna learn 한국어 for BTS I'm a little confusing with the pronunciation with ㅎ from the start to till now. Which one have we need to pronounce the sound of ㅎ or ㄴ in  당연하지? Does is sound [당연나지] or  [당연하지]? Is there a romanized version? Just asking because I’m very new to this 감사합니다 good  korean  lesson  ,come  from  china I literally can’t pronounce 뭐 먹을까  😭 Jisoo learning English for blinks and we blinks started learning koren for bp❤️😭😭 Awesome! / Oh, my god! 
Lit bro , big success My Korean mum told me to watch this haha Thank you so much this is so helpful for a better pronounciation! ^^ I am here for btsssss
Armies anneong
Saranghayo 
Borahae Why is she pronouncing su-go as su-gu? Remco Breuker is a North Korean spy. So many people learning Korean because of bts. I can't say anything though cause I am too learning korean for the foreign exchange student to be more comfortable! 당신은 아주 잘 읽었습니다. 나는 당신에게서 읽어야합니다. I learnt everything here and I’m a basic half Korean learning for a father that is not even here. Hell who knows if he’s alive join my ARMY club Can't we put 'nanen' when there is I'm in any sentence I just changed my profile pic and I'm not used to it so I was just singing cause I'm bored lol and I saw the pic and I almost got a heartattack The things you do for bts... for bts here It was really helpful. Thank you for your great effort Lol I'm watching this so I can learn what the Korean mukbangers say lol 7:36

안녕! umm plzz is it the same for you she he they?? Is this suitable in spoken form or written form? I watch this every night before sleeping. I hope I will remember all . This is so helpful. I am a bloody beginner. I hope these verbs will help me for beginning to learn korean. Why is 일어났어요 with 어 and not with 아? Ppajireul
빠질을 i like this 😻😻🇰🇷 I'm learning this so I can understand what my oppa says 😭 THANKS MUCH AS HELL IS KINDA EASY Good! 와 저는 초보자인 것 같았는데 이 단어 이미 다 알았어요! 깜짝이었어요~~ 톡투미인코리얀 덕분에 한국어를 잘 한 것 같아서 정말 감사합니다! 3년쯤 TTMIK 책으로 열심히 공부하는데 한국어 읽기하고 쓰기를 엄청 늘었어요. 지금은 말하기하고 듣기를 늘고 싶어서 한국어 선생님이 있는데 TTMIK로 공부해서 한국어를 잘 한 것 같아요^^ Isn’t drink 마시다 as well? 加油 According to my observation, I think it is like this,
1. Present tense - verb + wo-yo 
2. Past tense - verb + wo-sseo-yo
3. Future tense - verb + ul geo-ye-yo. These guys are so awesome to do this type of video in this type of way. So effective and helpful. And they say it slowly and fast a s few times. This helps me a lot to know fast what would be the word if it will change to present past and future. Im watching this while writing. So good i KNEW 29/30 WORDS OMGGGGGG. The first time I watched this video I knew like 21. is there another video like that with more words in 3 tenses? korean is gonna be my 3rd language, and i'm so happy of what i've made so far and i'm only 15 years old. 9:34 좋네 Thanks for  verbe Korea T love you You lost me at 먹다 meaning to eat AND to drink when I know that’s false.... so now I can’t even tell how reliable talktomeinkorean is😪 also... how come a different creator is using the expression bright/dark vowels where 아 and 오 are bright vowels and use -아요 and 어 and 우 are dark vowels that use -어요?..... is this false? I’ll give some examples:
오다 —> 오+아요 = 와요
먹다 —> 먹+어요 = 먹어요

And anything that isn’t 아, 오, 어, 우 is automatically a “dark vowel” and uses -어요 How come one person says “yoo “ at the end of a word and the other voice says “yoh”.  It’s really confusing 😩 What korean dialect is this ??? are all of these forms for him/her as well? if not then is there any video for it too? Why conjugating "to be easy" is so hard in pronunciation lmaaaooo, IRONY reminder to wtch this video whole again for writing!! What if the verbs are in the middle of a sentence? 어렵다/쉽다 are adjectives tho am I wrong? what's it doing on the verb playlist? Hey!? You're from the free learning app cake right??! learning korean for @JYPETWICE Thank you I'm saving this to my watch later 🙂. 진심 한국어 동사변형문 겁나 많아서 이걸 어떻게 공부할지 궁금하네 thank you, pronunciation is clear Is it the same casie from cake English!?!?! I've a question
Why did we used ㄱ in 읽다 
And ㄹ in 읽어요 It's interesting to note that 알다 (to know) does not become 알을 거예요 but instead, it gets conjugated to 알 거예요 (I will know). Is there an explanation for this? Ong it's super easy to study like this it would be nice if they had "talk to me in Japanese" ;-; I am learning Japanese too there is no videos on verbs like this one! Chuwayo 😊 Nice Thankyou so much for this video . It helped me alot and I improved also . Keep making more videos ❤️❤️👍👍 고맙습니다 thanks the fact that i know all the verbs here in this video, i'm proud of myself T_T Thank you for this TTMIK team! So easy and thoughtful like your books. Also, love the Animal Crossing vibe music... so cute (^_^*)/ I always underestimate the importance of verb until I finally know the importance of making a full sentence. Because a verb is necessary to form a correct sentence, it sounds like stupid but it’s true. Is there a continuation of this video.. like the next 30 essential korean verbs .... pls let me know... My wife is Korean and she said some of these are incorrect, so be careful about using these sentences in daily life. Why does she say yo as you and the male says it as yo??? 🤔🤔🤔 i dont understand do you use same conjugation for he she they we? 14:29 This background song is amazing 🔥 Have you noticed that Cassie Casper is also there in the cake English advertisement........😮😮 Why in some words the characters 워 are used in conjugation and in other places it is not

E.g 가다--->가었어요(i went) has no 워

귀엽다--->귀여웠어요(it was cute) has 워 added 0:38
1:29
2:01
2:33
3:08 Love you Cassie! You’re so charming and love your lessons Why does the 'p' sound sometimes get changed into 'w'? Can someone answer this for me please? awesome work Am happy❤️ I thought ㄱ(g) and ㅋ(k) so why is 먹다(meok-da) and not (meog-da) 10:08 nothing imp just a time  marker😄 Hi, I have question. I noticed that 듣다 became 들어요. How come the ㄷ changed into ㄹ? Is there a rule for like this one? Thank you! Thank you so much for this video.... i learned so many new verbs. 감시합니다. This is the best 
I feel so good that i knpw most of em like 27/30 and i've been learning for 2-3 months only prouuddddd yaaaa 
tysssmm I have learn some of these in my lorean class Thank you all Thamk you for this video. I 'd like to buy the guide book you meant on this video.Could you send me the link ? Sometimes you also need to know the robotic voice Now this is an effective learning, kamsahamnida!! What is the correct pronunciation for " to be good / to like" ? Because in the video the male voice says it as "jo-dha" and the female voice says it as " chu-dha"? What's the correct pronunciation? It's really a good video....bcoz it also includes 3 tenses...thank you... Korean is the hardest language that I have ever tried to learn...even Mandarin... ㄹ-s will forever destroy my handwriting :”)) Wait...which is formal and informal? to all the people who know AmandaRachLee, listen to the background song of this video carefully. :D 6:55 i was learning korean this quarantine for about 1week and i downloaded the app  KORLINK and it was very HELPFUL i know already how to introduce and how to say PRESENT PAST FUTURE TENSEE THANKS TO TALK TO ME IN KOREANNNN!!! 정말 감사합니다 But these are informal ways, right? Is there a different way when the conversation needs to be held in a polite level? 10:09 (please don't mind this, I need to see where I left off~) As someone who speaks Serbian, English, and German it is not quite clear to me how the following expressions can be verbs: to be easy, to be difficult, to be cold, to be hot, to be cute, to be cheap, to be expensive. Easy, cold, hot, cute, cheap... are adjectives and adjectives are words which describe nouns and pronouns....Soooo?!?! i have a question, if meo-geo-yo is "i eat", how would you say "we eat" or "he eats" or "she eats" ??? Thank you so much! I'm so excited to learn Korean! Do you have any free suggestions to learn the language? I am just a kid, but am very interested in the language! This is extremely helpful. 나는 공부 을 거예요! It’s weird listening to the girl say it different than the guy. I feel like he is the one with the correct pronunciation. 🤦‍♀️ Wow, my drama noledge is really helping my korean friend said that for the future tenses it should be 에요 instead of 예요 😭 i'm confused ㅠㅠ I dont understand why suddenly they place  ¨wo¨ at the end of the word for example when using the word cute  in the examples :s Thank you very much for this video! Can these also be used as he/she/it/we/they, or are those different? If you were making a sentence “I thought I would make friends.” Would you form the sentence by saying “나 친구들이 만들거 같아서요.” ?? Can you eliminate the “예요” from “만들 거예요”?? I was able to pronounce all but one word before they pronounce the word I'm proud of myself I will be buying this book as well 감사합니다 :) Now how is gonna remember this? This was SO useful!!! 감사합니다 🙏🏻 why cheap expensive ..etc. are verbs and no adjectives? the lady n the man both speak differently, very confusing for beginners..is it 'yo' or 'yu'? 7:42 very  very useful videosame with 日本語 huh! sweet! It’s kind of funny because in AAVE the object is usually the most important so “saw a movie” has a stronger sentence essence than “I saw” and makes way more sense For me sov is easy ,my mother tongue is in sov , while studying  I relate korean to my language it  is easy rather than in English. I am learning English for a while but it is still tough for me, I think korean is a simple language it has so many similarly with my language. For me it is easy my mother tongue is in sov , korean relating to my language is easy rather than English. hey guys Im Korean I wanna advise you guys not to spend too much time learning grammar
becuz Korean grammar is very very like mobile 
Im for sure that 90% percent of Koreans dont follow gramatical rules 
they just talk without thinking any thought 
anyway I mean you dont need to spend too much effort to learn grammar 
becuz we Koreans dont actually follow that rules  ( in routine like  ) Aww my name is alisha too I'm learning Japanese and its too hard cos of kanji, so I'm checking Korean. Just to see if its easier. aappl test tmmrw ;-; im korean yet i donot know any korean words what shall i do I think korean word order is very similar to indian languages. it makes it easier to form a sentence in korean if I think in any indian language 5:11 BEST CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE FOR LEARNING KOREAN💖💖😄😄😄 스시를 먹었어요 Do na-neun and Je-ga both mean I ? i'm working in gorvernment as office worker for south korea and native korean and 29 years old. i want to learn english and exchange language with american. give me a message all asian grammar are kinda same Same grammar with Kurdish language 🙂 this was so helpful, thank you! 나 is an informal way and 봤어요 is a formal way. That sentence in really strange, you should rather say 저는 영화를 봤어요 BROOO I went into this thinking Korean was gonna be hard but it’s really easy! I just now learned the grammar and now nothing can stop me 😈 My goal is to rewatch hwarang without eng subtitle👀 Its the same with japanese.. 5:06 recap Bts army where u attt It is really confusing to learn with english but luckily in my mother tounge 'Marathi' the grammar is same as korean😁 I’m indestructible, Japanese grammar lives in me. 😎 Thank you for making it cristal clear ❤️ Tamil , korean , Japanese are same grammar 😂❤ I can speak three languages: persian, turkmen turkic and english. I hope I can learn more languages in the future. I sometimes think I can't. I hope I can continue. Basically, the word order in Korean is same as Hindi, i.e. SOV The fact that I learned both English AND Korean through this lmaoo wow I’m over here 12 bad at English taking a spanish class and trying to self teach meh self korean ;-; everyone is coming because of bts but i come here because of red velvet and gfriend as they are my 2 ult groups🙈🙈 So Korean is very similar to Japanese? What is the difference between ( 나 , 내가 , 나는 , 저 , 제가 ) ? I mean how and when I can use each of them ? Well my mother language is just the same so I'm feeling quite easy......😅😂😁😊😎 Thank you very much it's really helpful and made me understand the grammar very well.😊😊😊 I understood more korean words than English HELP Actually, Chinese is also topic- prominent language we also say went to the movies if someone asks us. So like, just imagine im talking to yoda in Korean? Korean and  tamil has the same structure I'm french , but learning english was way more easier😂 now i struggle in French ,why did they make this language this difficult ..And i'm here now, learning Korean to have struggles in English and more in French 😭 best channel for teaching korean Who else loved the starting sound All for kpop i remember hating learning grammar in elementary and now I'm like OMG WOWOWOW ENGLISH IS SO WACKKK HOW DO I KNOW HOW TO DO ALL THIS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABT IT Can anyone give me link of the second chapter plz i couldn't find it I already know some Japanese so it won’t be hard to learn Korean but the pronunciation got me stressed 😩 Im not only here just to learn korean because im gonna watch BTS live without sub

and because i will marry them without watching the subtitles 😃 Here i am learning korean while im supposed to learn tagalog🤦

my korean is better than my tagalog and i am half Filipino Japanese. 🤦 I'm not even good at my first language, but here I am learning Korean for English speaker This vedio was helpful but is it enough for learning korean grammar Am I the only one here who's not a kpop or kdrama fan, haha? I'm an English major and want to teach it in a foreign country one day. it'll probably be South Korea, maybe Japan. I have learn 6 langueges. And korean  is my seventh langueges So wait until the end of a sentence to find out what they’re talking about it’s so hard because the word always changes when you put it into a different sentence almost everytime i see the videos. as for in english you don’t have to do that lol. this honestly helped the most Korean order is same like Indian order This was so easy to understand OMG thank u These dudes robbed me of a subscription I didn’t realised I’d signed up for and now I’m getting as much as I can out of their website and yt. Just a WARNING when you sign up for a free account on their website they ask you if you want to pay just £1 for access to all these things. But it’s not just £1 your signing up for the premium account. I’ve been trying to save up for collages coz I have no one to pay for me and I’ve only managed a couple hundred they took £40 of that which is a big deal to me. Don’t fall for it. So this is what I’m confused about do they have A’s and the in Korean would you say I saw A movie or did you see THE movie or ...? My native language Bengali uses the same thing as Korean Annoyngchumuseyo maturity is when you realise your language has the same grammatical structure It's esay to learn because the same thing SOV also work with hindi 
So it pretty esay for indians.. i think 'malayalam' language is also based on subject object verb, which is one of the indian languages.. hope this will make my korean learning easier since i am a malayalee Can you help me saying " MOKTA EMUSIK " Is right to say does this now means I had eaten my food ????? please help me out !!!!!! Korean language is very similar to japan. similar to the Japanese grammar Same like Hindi I’m coming fused why she said apple goes first because it’s the object but the rule was (sov) so the subject should come first Wait I just realized I'm watching this exactly 4 years ago- Why is there like so many ways to say I? Like my brain hurts. Alright, since my mind is flexible, and I'm not a monolinguist, I should be able to do this

You can do this, just don't give up, me 진짜 감사합니다!😢❤❤❤ thank you so much you're lessons saves my life❤❤❤ This word order is same to all Indian languages Does anyone else think that the man speaking sounds like johnny from nct? So Yoda is half korean It’s all because of kpop isn’t it 😂❤️ For desi people here, even we have same kind of sentence structure. For eg normally even we say 'maine movie dekhi' 
I find korean and Hindi very similar in some ways. So it's basically Japanese. nooooooo I'm doing japenese right now and I was jhoping. Koreans dident use particles. And there longer then Japanese particles whyyyyyy I just wanna understand bts and nu'est music. beauitiful


but i donot know where new or reapeat in channel ? Actually my mother tongue (Bengali) and Korean are pretty similar pronounciation and grammar wise so it helps a lot like japanese: ringo o tabemashita -> Apple a ate Hindi is also SOV and Topic prominent language

So because of this same grammatical thing,
as being Indian, Korean grammar doesn't sound strange to me😁 Trying to learn for bts *I know how to write but I don't know what it means*


*-inhales-* So I literally doing this for exo lol HSHS Persian is like this too... Lmao ARMY is literally everywhere!!! We are all here to learn Korean, arent we 😆? Well, I think , if English n korean both r not ur mother toungue, then this channel is a great platform to know both the languages closely, coz not jus korean is made easy hear, I can speak English well, but I'm seeing it from a different perspective, thanks a lot for the video.. But how you know what you reading .. what movie? It was really helpful thank you very much 한국어 마스터함 Bro you said that nanun meant "i" but then out of nowhere mention Je-ga as "i" bro im confused af is jega like me myself or I? SOV is also used in Turkish so learning korean should be easy So korean sentence structure is similar to Japanese... That's good Hindi also uses SOV order I'm not having difficulty because I know Hindi that has similar structure to korean I actually knew about it. But just for a recap. But i think korean grammar is hard to learn.ගොඩක් ස්තූතිය සර් Thanks sir korean alphabet eka kiyala dunnata තවත් කියන්න දෙයක් නෑ! හිතේ තියන හැමදේම කට්ටිය කියල ඉවරයි! ඒක නිසා කෙටියෙන්ම මෙහෙම කියන්නම් ( 💐 Thank you soo much sir!! 🙏🙏) 😃😃😃 මාරම පැහැදිලි සර්..හොදට කියන දේ තේරෙනවා😎❤️ Good !

3:12 1:38 I understood EVERYTHING here omg😭😱 i expected to come to this comment section and see other beginners bragging about how they understood everything meanwhile i could only understand half of each sentence. however, i'm glad to see im not alone here! i got 12 correct answer I would say upper beginner but it's still very useful Been seriously studying for less than a month but could understood almost everything (at least 90%). Some specific words like sugar and flour slipped but I still understood the gist of the conversation and got all but one question correct. Is this beginner like the title says or upper beginner as most of the comments seem to suggest? Vaya, entonces soy menos menos menos mucho mucho muchos menos que un principiante absoluto, pero sí pude contestar algunas, jajaja I could answer and understand some of the questions but because I have taken some classes before. Although this video is very useful, is not in an 'absolute beginner' level. am i dumb? The conversation is too fast!!!!! i actually feel like like crying c'est les mêmes dialogues que en japonais, c'est dommage mais bon ça m'aide quand même pour la structure ! Remember watching and struggling with this about two years ago in college. Living in Korea now and this has become childsplay. Quite satisfying! For those of you struggling here, dont give up! Youll get much better someday through your work :) On the one hand, this definitely isn't for absolute beginners, but on the other hand, the vast gulf between "truly absolute beginner" and "having a level of ability that is of any use in conversation whatsoever" is so vast and seemingly insurmountable that it may as well all be "absolute beginner". I understood most of this and yet my Korean ability is still completely and utterly useless in a real life setting with actual Koreans. This is more like intermediate.. heheheh two years later i come back to this video and i understand 89% of it I listened to this a few months ago when I was a true beginner and understood almost nothing. I listened to it again (about half a year into self-studying Korean) and literally understood every single thing without the subtitles. I wouldn't say it's for absolute beginners so if you're an absolute beginner and don't understand, don't feel discouraged! Give it some time (and study!) then come back to it. 화이팅! Sometimes understand sometimes is a mess , once you place the subtitles i read the hangul and understand everything, need to master my listening I came hear bcz I want to know what bts is saying are u to 
👇 Intermediate not beginners ary ,...
this is to high for me 🤓 ㅋㅋ.. got 5 wrong answers so confusing, I'm just basing it on the context.. can't understand the whole situation but I can grasps the meaning through context WTFudge! Absolute beginning? Korean class 101 maybe try teaching real beginning words and slow the freak down so I can understand. I had a subscription to your website and canceled because I am learning more Korean from 90 day. So disappointed in this video. 나는 한국인인데 이걸 왜 보고 있지 .. 영어  듣기나 해야겠다 for absolute beginners? i like it so much! it suits my beginner level. its challenging but not that hard as well. thank you! T~T this is for beginners? if there is someone want to practice korean with me in insta or telegram plz tell me in the comment ✨🙆🏻‍♀️. i have been studying korean for one years and i can read , write and speak korean but I have problems with listening 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️.
even though my level is intermediate 😂😂😂
i think i should focus on my vocabulary. 7:45 공부용인데 그렇게 정확한 영상은 아닌 것 같네요 외국어 배울 때 유튜브에서 이런 영상 많이 보고 도움받고 있었는데 갑자기 그 영상들에 대한 신뢰도가 살짝 하락함.. High for me 토익LC 공부하다가 반대느낌이 궁금해서 찾아옴ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I've been learning korean for over 4 years now, but I stopped for a year so I am refreshing on everything. This is definitely not absolute beginner. Even at my level I missed some things. I don't know why I'm watching this




I'm a Korean just a reminder for me: i can understand like 10-20 percent and more by guessing than actually understanding, hope to improve more in the next 3 months I'm proud that i understand without reading the translation ✋😭 After 5 months of studying Korean, I'm so proud of myself for understanding almost everything ^.^ I'm still having a hard time with numbers tho.
-ps. To everyone who are studying Korean, 화이팅!!! After watching 8 years of Runningman and without having any lessons. I can answer most of the questions. XDD This is not "Absolutely beginner" level. the restaurant was the only eeasy one but im not a aaaabsolute beginner. these arent exactly for absolute beginners 

the first one would have been easier if i knew the picture was books ㅠㅠ I think it’s listed as absolute beginner as an incentive to buy their course. 

I think it’s a little deceptive to list it as such. I am from South Korea.  I also practiced listening while studying English, but it is not easy.  I understand your situation! i was wondering about this sentence: “무엇을 주문할 거에요?” 
this is the future tense, isn’t it? and it’s exactly ‘할 거에요 or 할 거예요’??? because what i learned is “할 거예요”, please help me i am so confused English is the best language. Trying to be bilingual is a waste of time Im not a beginner but im just here- Eu só entendendo o inglês: 👁️👄👁️ At 3:26, I think it should be 문 닫는 시간 not 문 여는 시간... Can anyone explain me that point? I agree with some of the comments, this doesn't seem like something for absolute beginners, but it was still very useful. I recognized a few words and sounds and this will be really cool to listen to again and again to get used to hearing people talk in Korean. Which part of this is for absolute beginners?? Good for beginner listener. I can understand if you give the hangul...need some pronounciation practice to connect the words and pronounciation like 수업. I couldnt catch it and instead just jump to 내용. im at lower intermediate level and i almost understand the whole video but i think the conversation is just too stiff? like two robots talk to each other lmao For those that do not understand why this video is for beginners, I think it is for beginners because it puts you in the position of a child who is learning a language for the first time. Someone who is a beginner should listen for familiar words, and also listen to this multiple times trying to hear familiar words each time related to each topic. This isn't to teach you a set of words or phrases in one sitting, but to practice comprehension of listening. i can understand quite a bit, but this is definitely NOT absolute beginner, more like lower intermediate. How is this absolute begginer level when im struggling to understand what the hell is even going on if i don't read the subtitles ?? This is insane Ive been learning for 7 months (im not counting the other two months since i was on and off) and this makes sense but this isnt for like absolute complete beginners Que jajaja no men This is not for absolute beginners.... Isnt age with korean native Numbers ? I'm doomed I can only understand 50%. I got all correct becoz I know all the answers in korean, like when she said hamburger, okay the answer is hamburger. when he says 토요일에 to me it sounds like 투에레 OMG, a few months (I guess 2) I was trying to practice my Korean listening skills and I just had like 2 answers rights, i could catch up some words but I really didn't understand what the girl or the speakers said. But after keeping with my studies I had all my answers rights, even if in my head I couldn't structure the sentence, I did understood the main ideas. I'm so proud of myself. I tell you this so you don´t give up on yourself and your studies. It may be difficult now but if you continue you'll see your progress, just keep going!!!!!!!! 아 진짜 영어 개어렵네 can any one help me sign in okay, I've been studying for more than 6 months, but I am still absolute beginner <<3 Oh my gosh I was not ready for this its so fast 😂😭 ill come back in a few more months I'm an absolute begginer and I can read and write in Hangul but I can't understand them now I'm tryna listen to how they speak so I can practice my ears and my mouth 😂 definitely not for ABSOLUTE beginners. help! wouldn’t “바닷가나 산에 갈까 생각하고 있어” translate more like “im thinking of going to the beach or the mountains” ??
and ㄹ 까 would make it sound like she’s asking his opinion... no? Didn't understand a single word, the title is wrong 😒 This is not beginner, it's intermediate 🤦‍♂️ 감사합니다 Guys who are saying "Not for absolute beginners":
This is called a "Listening Comprehension", which means you come hear to listen to korean conversations in order to be more fluent in the accent or something like that; This is not "Learn how to speak" Toturial. Thanks. This isn't absolute beginner but idk, I feel like it did help a little I'm surprised I could answer like half of these even though I never actually studied Korean 😭 I just always try to link subtitles to words when I'm watching a Korean show I'm a Korean guy and I thank you all for loving our culture 😍😊 I will love all of your cultures as well😌😌👍👍 아르바이트 is the Korean word for part-time job? It sounds like the German word "Arbeit" which means "work". Interesting! I got full score, however its a little bit difficult for beginners as there are some intermediate expressions but still worth trying it. Although it is not absolute beginner. i'm a mid-intermediate learner who has decent listening skills but i still barely understood the first sentence. it took me a few replays to get it... i don't think this is absolute beginner material haha ...things i do for kpop... Wow I understand 98% of it Don't use 죄송합니다 when trying to say excuse me,that's just wrong.
Use 저기요 instead Wow I actually understood the conversation, The power of vocabulary This is an upper beginner lesson. They talk so fasttt 😂 I struggle with hearing comprehensive 😭 I honestly thought this was really tough at first, but I keep rewatching it and it’s definitely helping with my listening skills. good teacher I haven't really studied Korean ever. I've been listening to Korean for quite a bit though. and I got 16/20. I think that's pretty decent haha 전 토픽에 6급으로 노왔는데 이게 힘들더라구요. 아직은 이거 알아들을 수 없으시는 분들이 걱정마셨으면 좋겠어요. I understood 70-90% of everything :) I need to work on time.. My brain went away after listening to this. My mind was translating every korean word to english. But I remembered that it's better if you don't translate the words to english and just understand the word. uhm I don't know how to explain it so never mind huhu I felt a bit bad about myself at first, but I'm so glad I read the comments saying this is definitely not for absolute beginners. I've been studying Korean for about 6 months and I need to hear every exercise at least 5 times before I can try to answer. This would be sooooo much better if the first reading with subtitles had no English 

Arrrrrrrghhhhh! Out of all questions, I got like 2 mistakes. This is really helpful, considering I've been studying korean for 4 years on my own. Definitely not beginner level. I was raised in a Korean household and taught Korean since birth, this is more on the intermediate scale! Also, the voice actors seem a bit too robotic for a beginner level audio, so this might not prepare listeners for the actual Korean language later in the future if they ever have to use it. This is so helpful. I'm self studying and I understand around 90% of this video. Thank you very much! 영어원어민들이 토익lc를 들으면 이런느낌일까? Damn i’m not even on an absolute beginner niveau? That shit hurt this is not for absolute beginners but ive been trying to learn korean for about a year and this is so useful !! i kinda understand written korean but i have troubles with understanding spoken korean so this video helped me a lot. its surprising but i understood at least 70% of the video ksjdjThank you for the instructions sir . I am learning Korean only of my world  my life  my luv and my everything my BTS 💜💜💜😘😘😘😘 Me came here to learn Korean cuz I'm moving korea cuz of JYP and they said I need to learn Korean so before going I'm learning Korean 😂😂I didn't know anything 😂😂😂 Why I wanna learn Korean is so I can eat the food and ...... Many Me learning korean...bcZ in future I wanna attend BTS fanmeet and do modelling in korea...😭😭😭 It’s not even that easy how it looks😂 Yes it’s maybe easy to memorize it but kinda hard to tell some of the consonants apart. Me: I'm gonna learn Korean 
After min: I'm not understanding anything 🗡️ I hope I'll learn Korean faster to understand what BTS saying.. And I want to talk with my bias in my dreams so I learning😭😭😭😭😭 Korean The fact that it tooks me 3 hours to watch and write all this is killing me. haha i mean i love to learn lenguages but i think i made more hours than it has to be LOL...


Ps: i hope ya'll understand me, cuz' my native lenguage is spanish ✌ One of my ult bias was live yesterday, but he doesn't know english and told us to learn korean.. so I'm here😀 Learn Korean because of BTS

Just learning from you rightnow Thnq..✌ Romans 10:9-10 : D Army are here 💜 thnk u for the learnings sir see u on ur next video I'm learning Korean because I wanna .

Many of the consonants sound exactly the same. I'm so confused. I listened a very beautiful korean song and just can't put off learning hangul anymore. Learning korean language only for BTS 💜💜 lots of love from india 😍😍 How read this plss help I learning Korea to read and write and I like to study there so it's easy to ,thanks for that So here I am along with my both sisters, lecturing them and noting down everything 😅😩.

Thank u for this, I really needed it. I will go on learning korean so I can understand my idols in 5 years or smth :,) 
but I’m gonna write it all down to practice every free minute 🤒😧😵😵😵 Thank you for a great lesson. I am a beginner in learning Korean and find this video super helpful. I have one question regarding the ᅰ  "WE " sound. This character ㅔ we pronounce as "E ", but should it be written in combination with ㅜ "U" sound as [  WE  ] and not [ WEA ]. I am talking about the description in brackets  [    ]. I am apologizing if I didn't express my question clearly. I just wanted to get a better understanding regarding the ᅰ compound vowel. Thank you in advance for your hard work and your consideration. 
Have a lovely day:) 

Kind Regards,

Zory I was going through many videos for Korean alphabet for beginners and this is hands down the best one I have come across till now. I think we should go hana hana....first learn the vowels and then go for the consonants...it would be better...slow and steady process...if you run you will soon get tired...✌🏼 This vdo is very systematic and nice...easy to learn Streeesed.... Too fast.   Pant pant... Breathe.... *Who is here to understand what our 7 angels are saying*  🥺💜 Who all are seeing this video in 2021❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Korean for BTS ❤️😘😘😘😘😘 There is kinda similarities of how you pronounced the "o" and "eo" together . How do I even know the difference? 1:07 - vowels Here I am for my 4 girls Erm i am terribly confused I can't remember properly if it was a video or from a language app but they said there are 24 letters 10 of which are vowels and 14 constants 296,790 out of the total number of views are definitely kpop fans(including me)😂😂 I am learning for my 7 boys and 4 girls...

I feel like giving up but can't cause I am tired of making my eyes jump from the subtitles to their face...

Btw... thank you so much for making this video. I understand easily after watching this video Who is here for bts 💜 9:39 Is where i continue Who is all seeing for bts Me: I can read Korean 

Also me: But Idk what the hell I am reading 10 percent for jobs 
Rest 90 percent u know 😁 Ooooooooomgggg. Sunney mein toh anand aara tha ...practise krtey time nani yaad aagyi..🤪 but har maidan fateh gaana lgake practise krni pdegi ..tabhi kuch ho payega.. The pronounation is a bit hard Love learned korean. It is really helpful 🙂 
Best Korean learning video ever 😍☺️☺️👍👍 No one:
Not even a single soul : 
Me: .....Aaron? Is that you? All learning Korean BCS of some purpose but am learning because of BTS😉😍😘 imagine knowing korean language 😍

no more eng sub needed for any kdramas💛
no more eng sub needed for bts run vids💜
will be able to sing any korean song❤
will be able to flex your korean on your friends😜
will be able to understand korean people conversation🤍



♡☆ *a dream come trueeee* ~♡☆ Who else is here for 7 boys💜 Wow i learned alot and I'm just 12 y/o how about you?how old are you learning korean? Im here to learn korean language coz i want to understand every single words of the lyrics sung by 7 boys. I know romanization of other languages is always imperfect, but why does it seem that the letters chosen in the romanization sound so wrong for Korean? Like the "J" sound character really sounds like "cha", it might be "jya" because I'm a beginner and my ear isn't trained to hear the subtle differences, but "J" sound seems so off...There's a "ch" sound for another character and I can only assume I can't hear the difference now.  I love the differences between ㅟ and ㅢ. Coming from Japanese this difference is familiar. Also the sound that's between the R & L sounds. Very familiar, I'm glad I can use that skill here. I just wanted to learn for watch kdrama😚❤️ I don't believe, I just learned this, this was amazing definitely thumbs up Like I can read but the pronounciation hits the worst You are actually speaking hindi wordsi am learning the language and when i talk to my friend i start in english and finish in korean i also think  in the language Handsome can be also called by "meosjin"
Jin: WWH 
😉😉😉 살쩠어 doesn't it mean i /lost/ weight? please tell me that these phrases are in formal or informal korean language I want to learn Korean so that I can rap like jin¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I have decide to learn Korean bts and blackpink is my inspiration If Jungkook can learn English then I can also learn Korean :) I want to apply Korean to my Keyboard but I'm afraid because i might not get things back to normal😂 Thank you so much! 1:15 😌 what oppa means?pls replie I only learned jeogiyo from miyeon hahahaah Are these  phrases formal or casual? Thanks for this video I can now learn how to speak 🇰🇷Korean 🇰🇷 Most of these phrases I have heard in RUN BTS episodes You actually start learning Korean: kalm
You start getting good at it: kalm
You start forgetting words in your native language: *panik* My mother learned arabic and she said writing what you have learned will help you learn, shes now fluent in arabic 2:18 I am coming back to this Tomorrow because I decided I am going to learn 20 phrases every 5 days (day 1 complete)
Finished at 4:36 (day 2 complete)
(Day 3 complete, I forgot to update it on here) finished at 6:45
(Day 4 complete 8:53) if im not wrong 확실해 mean is "are you sure?" R these formal or informal I'm learning Korean language  only for watch BTS Vlive & RUN BTS  without subtitles.....😙😙

Otherwise like always while watching Vlive be like: *I don't know what are they saying but let's laugh*  

Am I the only one learning Korean language for that reason? ☺ Surprisingly I know almost all of them. My 6-month self studying Korean is worth it. I'm moving to Korea and I have to learn this shit cuz I don't want to sit there with onion haseyoh great video but got ruined by the music, can't hear the pronounciation well This is awesome. I love it. Thank you for this video. wahhhhh i'm eager to learn this language i hope so someday i will be fluent : ( but it's hard to pronounce as well fighting😩💪 I am learning Korean for fun and once travel Korea 💜😃 Thanks I learnt many things As soon as you become bts army we all want to learn the  Korean language 😂😂💜 Is this true can you please answer me 억기 고맢솜니다..♡ thx so much!

Once u pay attention it's the easiest to learn🙂 Am I the only one pouting my lips tryna read these sentences 😂😂😂 살쪘어는 왜 넣은거야 ㅋㅋ I know lots of  word in korean.i tried my best to Learning this language.😅 I’m doing this for our Jisoo Unnie! Anyone excited for snowdrop? Please dont only learn korean for kpop groups and kdrama also learn it for their CULTURE .. 안녕하세 may i know if these words are formal or casual form , I'm a complete beginner so can anyone help me out ? Why is it not getting in my head is my inspiration of reading korean comics that low... In lockdown i decided to learn about korean my inspection is bts and blink 
📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚 is oli london teaching this bcz its written salanghae not saranghae Learners be careful using these phrases cause these phrases  used with friends . These are not polite. Learners be careful using these phrases cause these phrases  used with friends . These are not polite. I'm still stuck with my weird japanese accent 😩 Are you Korean???? Same , my inspiration is also BTS
And am in 9th so I have very time to learn korean👍👍 Gamsahamnida 🥰🤗❤ 
You're teaching skills are amazing i feel like a nursery student repeating after her teacher 😄 
How many are learning korean for bts or athor kpop grp and also for understanding k-drama's 💜💜 bts made me do this......^^ Learning korean only for BTS😍😍 It's better Without the music 🙂 Subject+object+verb is same in  Hindi and Korean language....but in English  totally opposite subject+verb +object 😪😪😪😴😴 that's why Hindi to Korea is easier then English I am learning Korean for BTS 2:09 yall its pronunced as ji'n shin iya 3:39

Don't mind me this is helpful! IMO, you can  turn down the BGM a little bit  bec i cant clearly hear each syllable. thanks! During this quarantine i want to learn  another language beside my mother language (indonesian language) but i was confused what should i learn first is it korean? Japanese? Or chinese language . It was so confusing . Can anybody  tell me what should i learn first? cause korean sounds easier than japanese or chinese Good that “maldo andwae” is known here in philippines, especially for those wattpad readers. trust me hehe 6:21 ONCES The moment I got to know its not ''Fighting'' but Hwa-i-ting... This is so helpful 😍I will note down everything in my notebook  and will learn it thnks alot 😍🖤 Ohhh i didnt know u have youtube channel i thought only instagram until i saw Sooooooooo "L" in korea sounds "R"? Am i right? This is litteraly all I've learned from kdramas T-T 5:58 . Why is this so relatable 😭😭 probably the rarest comment here : i enjoy BTS but im here for EXO AND NCT and because im into the culture and language

bonus :
6:23 im like TT I'm learning korean bcs one day I want to visit it not for bts but for ateez (and my multistan heart ,♡), so far this is my longest obsession LMFAO. ((I tried learning Japanese once but I've gotten bored after a week, so I'm kinda proud of myself rn) No one me who saw a BTS add before learning Korean for BTS 😅💜 Learn it cuz you would like to see your idols faces rather than the subtitles 4:30 I'm a once, blink, army, moomoo and much more etc.. 
mainly a blink but am I the only one learning Korean just for learning Korean?
Before I knew about K-pop I still wanted to go to Korea and learn the language because I was interested in it.
I have a list of languages I want to master or learn the basis of it. I'm a hard worker and I have much more of my life left and my genes from family usually live up to 100's or in the 90's. So I have a lot of my life to do whatever and the rest to learn.


*M Y   L I S T*

-Korean
-Filipino or Vietnamese
-Thai
-Mandarin or Nepali
