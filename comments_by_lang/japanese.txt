チーズオムレツ Does this really work anybody tried this?? I want to learn Japanese because I want   to watch anime without subtitles Thanks for the tuotorial really enjoyed it ;) I just hope I won't wake up to only say "omelette du fromage" I just realized I’m gonna have the most fucked up dreams when I sleep to this. Does this work Everyone here to understand a line when watching anime sub 6:00:00 Great, i didnt understand anything because i am literally sleeping Anyone here leaning japanese for anime I woke up with my willy Pixelated I just want my dad to stop telling me my grammar is trash 💀 サメ い 土 トオ あんｄ い ぉヴェ いｔ 
てゃｔ わｙ のｔ ごいんｇ と ぃえ テョ i tried this once with Russian, scariest experience of my life I'LL WATCH THIS VIDEO EVERY NIGHT UNTIL I LEARN SOMETHING... IS IT UNHEALTHY FOR THE BRAIN OR SOMETHING? MY DREAMS TURNED TO "JAPANESE MODE" 8:06:24 Bold of you to assume I sleep 8 hours You can't learn languages while you sleep, put in actual effort. I find this video :🤩
always me that I realize that to make it work I must also know English :🥲
(I am italian🙃🥲) Me after sleeping : ima, watashi ha nihongo wo ryûchô ni hanasu kotogadekimasu Di manlang ako makatulog Me: Chilling in bed
My sleep paralysis demon: Sumimasen where is the fridge ? O genki desu ka. Out now brand new powerful fiber... yup, adverts ruined this peaceful wee video :( If u wanna know if this works the answer is no Imange just waking up after 8 hours and you start speaking Japanese to your parents. I used this to calm my burning hands After reading the comments before watching, now I just wanna try it to see what wierd thing happens to me if I try No. . . Yea yea This reminds me of the that one episode in “Dexter’s Laboratory” I think dexter made a machine, so when he goes to sleep he listens to it and learns French 😂👌🏼 I'm a spanish speaker learning english and japanese at the same time lel Is there a download for this for members that can play without the video? does this actually work? me: sleeping peacefully thinking im going to wake up and learn Japanese:

an ad about depression: *ima end this mans whole career* Just watching hololive and anime made me learn most of the phrases Is my screen going to turn off by itself while I'm sleeping?
Also will I have earing problems? ティッシュいっそ船lobeいt。I’m still learning so if I said something wrong pls correct me 😊 I watched this video and now I woke up in a pit in Iraq So... a lot of people are saying how they can't fall asleep because of ads. I usually say this as a joke, but if you're playing the video on your phone, download Brave. At least for me it blocks Youtube ads. Don't get it on your computer because it will take away the skip ad button and you won't be able to watch your video. Happy sleeping. 

Oh- and watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. 

It's not THAT gay. If your worried about ads just skip to end and restart video, it should get rid of the ads Waw 😄 If I sleep to it then I'll update Gave me nightmares me: *sleep*
The ads: *sus smile* Im dead from comments i had a dream about how i was laying in the bed and i saw a hand doing hang signs💀 Nghe ghê vl. :))  đi ngủ mà nghe. Chết tuiiii. :))) Lucky I found this atau 03:45 AM So you’re trying to learn Japanese?










Oh kawaii koto. now my friends are not able to understand me😶 I click only because of Ukyo's picture I think i know some of this words but i really never know the right spelling. So cool I went to sleep listening to this I woke up and suddenly I’m Japanese and living in Japan thanks! Me actually falling asleep
Ad: I SAID WE AWAKE While I was sleeping, I almost had a fucking heart attack hearing "sayonara"  so close to my ears. Sheesh. 😭😰 *Falls asleep listening to Japanese language*

*Wakes up speaking fluent Spanish instead*

Que,,,!!! What if your parents knew you wear learning japanese and were like "eyy answer this in japanese, are you gay?" And your just like, "eyah" Just... Don't : 4 hours of sleep, I woke up after terrible sleep I don't know what's funnier the fact you think i can sleep or the fact you think I can learn Everybody gangsta til you start forgetting how to speak their own language Skip ads 10:00:00 Me: *speaks two languages at 13*
My dad: *speaks ten languages at 53*
Me: I MUST BE BETTER!!!!!!!
BETTER!!!!
Also me: trying to learn french, Japanese, German, Spanish and Korean because they are the only languages I can think of that my dad doesn't know. I just woke up from a bad dream where the covid vaccine turned me into a giant and then there's a small guy who's flying like Spider-Man with a sword who sliced me before I wake up... Dang so weird i wish i dream about this video while listening and sleeping 😂😂 im honestly just here for the funny comments... hello teacher, nice to  meet you i like to study with you teacher 12:31 just mark where I leaved I only clicked on this vid for the comments If this really works, im supposed to be the most math genius student in my school because I always sleep in math class. :,D emang bisa belajar sambil tidur Bold of you to assume I sleep 8 hours Nothing happend TwT I was really hoping it would work I’m gonna try again and then give up Solo entre por la foto de Ukkyo didn't work im not gay!! People talking about the ads in the comments me with youtube premium that is not a problem for a god of destruction Kachow I'm brazilian and i'm learning english and japonese with 1 vídeo hohohoho *Reads the title*

Me: What is this *_Sorcery_* How to make a *sleeper agent* 101. too many weebs I'll give it a try today. Tomorrow I'll tell Me while watching anime - oh ye I know japanese 
Me while not watching anime - what is this hahj Only came here for the thumbnail.. i liked the amnesia otome game So has this actually worked for anyone? Fingers crossed I wake up as a harem protagonist 🤞 Me: -scrolling thew the comments section to see if this worked - This would be better if I got 8 hours of sleep, but no I'm built different Quien mas habla español? XD

Yo queriendo aprender japonés pero a la vez Ingles 😂😅 Rip i rlly wanna learn Japanese rn, even tho i am...But the thing Is that


I watch and prefer Dub anime (without subtiles ofc) 


DONT HATE AND KILL MEW PLS, I STILL  WANNA LEARN JP, OKIES XD Imagine if this thing taught swear words i woke up sitting at the back of the classroom by the window Why are there people complaining about ads if you can just download it then turn off your wifiLearn to read & write in Language FAST at JapanesePod101.com! Get the FULL VERSION of the exclusive writing course + TONS of other lessons that get you speaking Language at 30% OFF: https://goo.gl/w7xJq4 What am i doing here, i already know hiragana ı finally learned hiragana :) It took me 3 days and around 6 sessions to learn all this, 
I have been rewriting them and learning phrases at the same time, 
I also have been spending majority of practice in VR talking to other japanese speakers,
took me  a while to learn  just for 1 hour video, but I'm confident I wont forget them

thank you! weird that in the example: 16:51 (su shi) the 'u' sound is very pronounced, but at 17:03 (su ki) pronounced (ski)... did i miss the a rule when to make the 'u' sound silent? will all (suk) have a non pronnounced 'u'? Omagad luve this Arigato 32:14 taking notes on this is actually really fun I wish this could help : 
The technique that I do is memorise 1 column a day I'm studying hiragana cause I thought the letters is cool Wonderful. I hope to learn hiragana fast... your every videos are useful and amazing. Thank you so much.😊 This has helped me so much. I've been looking for somewhere that would help me, but nowhere helped me improve, I could memorize anything but this channel has made me understand hiragana way better and memorize it 19:01 i cant do this :( Me being japanese and trying to see if this video is any different than learning japanese at school: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Please someone tell me:- I have learnt till 2nd row (10 characters and 15 sounds). I am getting all answers in quiz correct but I have to pause the video for 3 seconds and then get to the correct answer. If it is a word, then it take around 6-7 seconds for me to speak out the answer. Is this speed okay or I need to be faster? Tip: If you're a complete beginner(with only certain words you know from anime) don't try to learn the whole script in an hour. Like please. Remember when in kindergarten you were taught the letters in English over a period of time? Maybe you won't need that long but divide it up. Like I started by learning the column with vowels and the k column along with dakuten/tenten the first day. I perfected the pronunciation as much as I could in a  day and then moved on to the next columns. Please don't try to rush the process. This took me 8 days to finish:) thanks for making it free

ありがとう ございます！₍ᐢ⑅•ᴗ•⑅ᐢ₎♡ But how to read every single word in Chinese pliz make vedio for Chinese language also 20:00 よくできました 丁度 Quick exercise if you finished this video: The poem "Iroha" is like our English "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", it has all the hiragana characters. So, try transcribing it to hiragana! (The original has both wi and we syllables, so I included the modern version as well, try both though because the new one is missing a few characters).

Old:
Iroha nihoheto
Chirinuru wo
Wa ka yo tare so
Tsune naramu
U wi no okuyama
Kefu koete
Asaki yume mishi
Wehi mo sesun

Modern:
Iro wa nioedo

Wagayo dare so
Tsune naramu
Ui no okuyama
Kyou koete
Asaki yume mishi
Yoi mo sezu Everyone is learning it because of anime but i'm learning it because I wanna move to japan I'm pretty sure I will not going to finish because I always forget things easily 🙂 this but good luck me

My handwriting in english is already bad enough! I come here to learn Japanese after 4 years of video uploaded but how ever I wanna learn full language it's my goal .... 🔥🔥🔥 OMG!! I never thought hiragana is so easy!!! Finally was able to read all hiragana char (katakana on progress), it's wonderful to be able to read hiragana sentence even tough you didn't understand the meaning of it 😁 i heard learning 2 in one go helps to learn much faster but i think im gonna learn separately? what do your think?  any suggestions? I'm here to learn japanese but also for the host

She's cute I will try to finish it tonight i hope i can do it now i know how much of a struggle it is for Preschoolers and kindys to learned the english alphabet ;-; 12:27 19:01 I'mma study Japanese so I can read manga and watch anime without subtitles. Also! It's rlly fun! Wait  what I just learned Im confused when you found out your'e 1% japanese 1:04:31 I found this useful. I used this to learn them all within 5 days, an hour each morning before work using flash cards during the day when I had time. Time to figure out Katakana now… 4:50 she said listen to podcasts/blogs to improve pronunciation..
i watch anime 🕳🤸🏻‍♀️ Wow! Back then I used to learn 5 characters a day . Can't believe I memorized all the hiragana characters in just one day. This just means your video is effective.Thank you very much. Tomorrow I'll start learning katakana and practice my hiragana on hiragana lyrics. :D Let's all do our best :D The problem for me is memorizing the alphabet plsss help. now i can read japanese anime subtitles this really helped tysm😩 I wouldn't say an hour but spent about 2-4 hours per day and in a few days and just finished. The title is still accurate to the presentation. 

Spent my time learning them, by practicing writing them. (I learn by sight and doing primarily, so writing made sense to help internalize the syllables better than just simply watching the vid.) It's not too much time investment if you already had a good handle on English classes when learning grammar and punctuation. 

Better to listen and accept first, then apply your knowledge of grammar and sentence structure, 2nd.

Great vid, thanks. On to Katakana~! 49:56 I actually just sat here for 1 hour😭 31:54 I'm taking a little rest idk if I'm lazy oof I'm exhausted. ありがとう Thank you from the bottom of my heart bcs it's free I really appreciate everything single lesson. I just finished lesson 1 and learned the first 5 vowel letters, thank you very much for this video, it helped me so much!


P.S: I'm learning Japanese to watch anime without subs- 
tell me I'm not the only one who does that- 30:33 I was not ready for that This is every weebs dream I'm taking it slow self studying with this and I'm slowly adding on every day, actually really cool I can read some Hirigana now. Hopefully by the end of this month I can read it fully so that my tutor isn't helping me with Romanji. Huge step learning to read foreign characters. I don't know why Japanese alphabet is complicated, even though I'm Japanese. ありがと。 pin for tom i am at 18:15 Hands down best channel on YT I learned more in 7 minutes from this than one month of Duolingo 38:35 DON'T MIND ME I'M JUST UH MARKING YES I am here so that I can read novels Personal Timestamp: 
12:32    16:35   26:34 
31:37 It took me 1 month to learn Kana
I'm so weak at memorization I learned all of this over the course of 3 days and now I'm just sitting here feeling empty I saw this at fyp Immediately pressed it so I can learn Japanese and watch anime without reading but hearing Indian here and Bengali is the Mother tongue Not me failing all the quizzes I took 3 lessons of this every day, this worked out so well for me I can't thank you enoughDon’t forget to…

Copied from another comment Oh God.. writing ko(こ) like that is really difficult Just imagine writing an essay in Japanese. I wonder how they do it. Like if you miss one little line it could become a completely different word. It’s like a PIN .. I forget it after 5 seconds 😆🖊👴🏼 Fix yg bljr bhasa Jepang psti wibu the fact that me and my mom were talking about learning japanese and this pops up lol ive never watched any videos realted to this tf yt spying me lol Hiragana POV: youre learning this for: watching anime and satisfying your ego I'm don,t what that mean?what you write for? Y'all- I don't want to sound stupid, and yes I Google searched what imma ask but I still don't get it... What is the difference between hiragana, katakana, and kanji? And is learning hiragana alone enough? Step 1: Press down on the pen like you’re trying to turn the paper into diamonds. For who didt know this....Japanese and Tamil have more similarities க,ர,ஓ,ந,வ,ஏ,அஆஇஇஞஞுறலஸ்ரீக்ஷலனேனரநோஸ்ரீஸ்ரீஸனேருந ect...lol For anyone who is confused where is g,z,d,b,p here is the explaination -

K-G
H-B/P
S-Z
T-D

They just add the two small lines at right top = が (ga)- the original one is か(ka)

But for  "p ", it is a little bit differrent it add a small dot at the top right = ぱ(pa) - は (ha)
Any question? Just ask me but i only know hiragana and katakana. ううううううう :0 Can I write using gel pen??? IAM new in learning so pls help me 筆跡がいつも間違っていることに気づきましま 1:14 not to be that person but i see gojo satoru Nice pen 私はそれが好きです 文章を上達させたい✍️ Este video me sirvió mucho porque tengo problemas a la hora de escribirlas, gracias 💜 .

I wrote chinese characters my whole life so I'm fine with kanji. Katakana uses parts of kanji/hanzi like エ(工)、ロ(口)、ハ(八)、イ(亻) 、ニ(二)、オ(才) so I'm familiar with the strokes. Hiragana is totally alien for me XD Japenese has no hu sound japenese has fu sound super..i am from sri lanka.thank you.best of iuck Do mo arigatho Gosimas sensea....✊ Kore musukashi na وييين حرف ال L؟؟؟؟ VietNam, Hà Nội, Tây Hồ.
