Before I have this stuff play all night in my ears, does this like even work? Can I actually learn Japanese while sleeping to this? Or am I dumb I forgot my friend was Chinese so I started speaking with him in Japanese So if your gonna get us to sleep while putting this on. Why the fuck did you put ads? How the heck can i get rid of the freaking adds like bro i keep waking up when an add plays decides to play roblox instead of sleeping* This is much better than Duolingo Is Japanese difficult for foreigners?
From my point of view, English is more complicated than Japanese. I was hearing starting to fall asleep and then a Add come on I’m like:OH COME ON An ad played while I was in the middle of this and now I’m afraid that if I go to sleep again I’m gonna learn how to advertise raid shadow legends Imagine waking up at 3 am only to hear a computer say: konichiwa Just woke up and I can speak alittle japanese Fucking recommended Learning this to play Hajimari no Kiseki and Kuro no Kiseki. The 5 o'Clock SHift endorses this video! i only clicked this video cuz the thumbnail was of my boy Ukyo from Amnesia and some old memories were unlocked Arigatou sayonara The second I saw this on my recommended I knew the comments would be golden I don’t think this really helps you get decent in Japanese pretty sure it just helps you know a few words to say and understand it bettter I was listening to this in peace and suddenly I just hear "iWa ChAaAaAaN" cause that's what I set my notification sound
またあとて Wha- does this work? Arigato gyro Domo is how it says thanks at 5:02 but at 13:03 it uses arigato, which I also heard previously at 2:54. So I'm confused now Gomene 🥵🥵🥵 kyrieeee Im probably gonna run low on battery if i do this😅 This has to be the dumbest thing that I've seen in a good while Briefly tried, but the English words are disturbing me from falling asleep… rip i thought "no" was "yada" or sum- turns out its lie I jad a dream of a girl..
The time i woke up i heard Sayonara.
And shit got crazy
(I was scared) I just wake up and i find out i was watching a 5 h long add 😭😭😭 I'm actually curious to know if this actually worked for ANYONE on here. Like I'm not gonna watch this video, I just want to know everyone's experience. Pantsu misete moratte mo  yoroshidesu ka can someone tell me if this actually works? I don't to keep my phone on all night if it doesn't here 00:28 no need to thanks me bruh i've just been following along and repeating what they were saying until i felt like i memorized them and got the pronunciations right, and i didnt realize i've already gone through an hour and a half of it.. thats a whole movie length with me just saying the same phrases over and over again wut the heck.. i had my eyes closed too and it did not feel like a long time o-o I had a dream where I was having a good day, eating cake, finally completing my biggest Lego project, and with someone I love the most but all of a sudden, I heard "Sayonara". I almost cried. I tried coming back to that Dreamland again but unfortunately I didn't. Tis was a sad day If you don't want ads skip to the end and then replay there will be none. Nice sleep :) I will learn this language for next few months,who is with me ? Nice 😁😁😁 Question: Did It Worked? Shita
desu ka
Google TL lmao Video: about to start
*Random Instagram ad appears
Video: 0:28
Me: you should be. I need some help, I'm trying to figure out out how to read the words on the screen with my eyes closed. I was listening to this and a random add show up it SCARED me I actually learned Japanese and English this way. LOL its only like 7 phrases I’m confused Sirius saying different and translations saying different and this is saying different idk what to believe Nite nite big guy i had a dream last night and me and the people in the dream were all talking japanese💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 I always do my assignment while sleeping, manage to finish 2 assignments in 2 days while having a good sleep. no Do you actually learn Japanese whiles sleeping with this on? Omelette du fromage Man I was halfway there, then suddenly, "Doulingo ad pops up", dam Doulingo a salty bird I'm scared if I do this, and the next morning I'll wake up I am in front of the heavens gate and the Angel said 'Gomenasai'....... :'3 Me just trying to learn Japanese 

Ads: Would you like to hear about our lord and savory Jesus christ? my mom: girl wake up

me: ohayo you fixed breakfast bitch?

my mom: WHAT YOU SAY?

me: gomennasai

my mom: da fuq?-- genuine question: does this actually work??? and if so how many times do you need to sleep to this to actually understand the phrases to an extent? I've been trying to learn Japanese for a few months now but I cant hold on to anything I learn for more than an hour. tfw you have a lisp🥲 How about Cheese Omelette in Japanese? Ara ara So this is how zenitsu learnt it Man...i was hoping i could get isekai'd into an anime series when i woke up 00:28 you’re welcome 10 million idiots who leaned absolutely nothing i want to learn both japanese and korean :( Im only doing this so I can watch anime in sub without reading これは日本語を学ぶ良い方法です。
This is a really good way to learn Japanese. i had a nightmare while listening to this idk why there was someone on my door saying "sayonara" Me: repeating japanese phrases
Also me: wait i don't know what am I saying coz I forgot to listen English phrases... yatayım bari Sayanoraaaaa OMG i know all the phrases in the video 😎🥳 started talking Japanese at a Chinese restaurant POV you wake up speaking ✨ JAPANGLISH ✨: Konnhiwassup? For all you lazy ppl 0:28 Arigatou gozaimasuka?
Oyasuminasen Moms when they receive their meal from a french restaurant: 7:33:23 if yall actually wanna learn japanese, i recommend actually sitting down and learning. theres no easy way to do it. this vid can be helpful in a way to make some words sound a little bit more noticeable, in a way. like you “remember” hearing it but dont exactly know it. im currently studying japanese and just now started korean so trust me its the only way to learn a whole language, especially if you speak english, because japanese grammar is completely switched LMAO Ok but does this actually work tho??? Someone who has tried it reply and tell me if it works or not. I really wouldn't like to wake up to an ad, thank you very much みんな私はビデオを聞いたが今は何も話せない
助けてください






Use google translate Better when awake. I like to listen on the bus home. Instructions was not clear.

I want to learn Japanese because I want   to watch anime without subtitles Thanks for the tuotorial really enjoyed it ;) I just hope I won't wake up to only say "omelette du fromage" I just realized I’m gonna have the most fucked up dreams when I sleep to this. Does this work Everyone here to understand a line when watching anime sub 6:00:00Learn to read & write in Language FAST at JapanesePod101.com! Get the FULL VERSION of the exclusive writing course + TONS of other lessons that get you speaking Language at 30% OFF: https://goo.gl/w7xJq4 Any Indian guys will learn Japanese Honestly I started learning Japanese cause the language sounds pretty Nihhon ありがとう ございます Why don't they just simplify like leaving kanji or using one script and use space. You really explained everything else in simple way
ありがとぐざいます😊 The O character looks like a man groaning in pain with his mouth OPEN. So, you can also remember it as O-pen mouth. 

The hiragana E character looks uncannily like a volleyball player setting the ball or returning underhand. That doesn’t help for learning though.  lol Learning japanese to talk with the friends of my uncle that lives in japan At 22:13, Risa explains that the chisai tsu (small “tsu” character) prolongs the consonant that comes after it.  Did she mean it prolongs the consonant that comes BEFORE it? Can I please be reborn again but as Japanese citizen I know I’m supposed to be learning but it’s adorable when she says “liblaly”. Ok now back to work I tried to write in Japanese, seems I'm good about it but sometimes my handwriting is bad but I tried my best as I look up in the screen or in a paper to copy then write but what I kinda struggling to write were the kanji characters because they look like Chinese alphabet but yet I manage to write it carefully as the same. I have one tip:don't learn this in one seating take a little break then continue that's how I did it 19:13 13:06 lol it's the guy from friday night funkin I’m a Japanese native but I’m here anyways, if you wonder if Japanese pod is reliable source for a Japanese I would 100% say yes after looking through their methods and lessons. It’s amazing that the provide good resources for free :) Im learning japanese since a week now and this vid helped me so much ngl to remember ku/< you could remember it as a damascus sweaty spiky tampon What the f is duck 10? Lol очень хорошо вы т
акая красотка люблюкитайский Me: This is pretty easy to write so far
N Column: Omai Wa Mou Shinderu
Me: なに Omg this is so easy to learn with the creative way to remember with objects. 1 Hour video but the studying goes beyong that.

Still a very good and helpful video! this is very helpful! Love to learn Japanese cuz of anime(Naruto) I think that while everyone else is learning Japanese to watch anime with the subtitles off, i might be the only one learning it so i can put the subtitles IN Japanese and read it… even now when I’m reading lyrics to my favorite Japanese songs or reading the subtitles on shows I’ll pick up on the hirigana i learned that day and say it out loud and get so excited… little by little it’s increasing how much i can connect what I’m seeing on the screen for my shows to what I’m seeing here with the lessons. A lot of people don’t understand how hard reading and writing in a language is. Even when we all learn our first language the concept of putting your thoughts onto paper causes anxiety in many people today and then having to read and understand another persons words is even peculiar. But i believe that by being able to read in Japanese and wrote in Japanese will make it easier to connect with the words and phrases but the culture and feel for the language. I am truly thankful for this video and all the hundreds or even thousands of videos you have done. Thank you in 2021 Took me around 3 days to fully grasp this, I did two lessons a day (sometimes more if I wasn't too tired haha), took notes, and wrote down each character 30 times a day including the ones from previous lessons so I can gain muscle memory

If you're having trouble on recalling each character this might help :D You should have given subtitles which would have been more useful EREN- 11:56 a i u e o It took me 5 days to memorize hiragana and it took me 9 days to memorize katakana reminder: 27:00 nya <3 for me is the word "complicated" in japanese the most complicated to pronouns I stopped on lesson 9, i'm exhausted lol. now my pronunciation of "F" changed its like kindergarten all over again except its in hard mode I just wanted to see redhead. Riza San, 
What is the course fee for conversational class. Can you please share the details. I imagian myself in pre-k sitting beside children learning ABC Japanese with them lol 13 minutes in and I'm pretty confident! ビデオ全体を完成させ、画面全体に書かれたものをノートに書きました。この素晴らしくて美しいチャンネルに感謝します。愛しています、リサ ❤️ Little help

ん n Im so gratefull i found this wonderful channel! Thank you so much for this video, now i know all the hiragana symbols and i can read and write them!! Ahh..finalllly i can read hiragana now..😭 after 727273 failed attempts in my offline class. What am i doing here, i already know hiragana ı finally learned hiragana :) It took me 3 days and around 6 sessions to learn all this, 
I have been rewriting them and learning phrases at the same time, 
I also have been spending majority of practice in VR talking to other japanese speakers,
took me  a while to learn  just for 1 hour video, but I'm confident I wont forget them

thank you! weird that in the example: 16:51 (su shi) the 'u' sound is very pronounced, but at 17:03 (su ki) pronounced (ski)... did i miss the a rule when to make the 'u' sound silent? will all (suk) have a non pronnounced 'u'? Omagad luve this Arigato taking notes on this is actually really fun I wish this could help : 
The technique that I do is memorise 1 column a day I'm studying hiragana cause I thought the letters is cool Wonderful. I hope to learn hiragana fast... your every videos are useful and amazing. Thank you so much.😊 This has helped me so much. I've been looking for somewhere that would help me, but nowhere helped me improve, I could memorize anything but this channel has made me understand hiragana way better and memorize it 19:01 i cant do this :( Me being japanese and trying to see if this video is any different than learning japanese at school: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Please someone tell me:- I have learnt till 2nd row (10 characters and 15 sounds). I am getting all answers in quiz correct but I have to pause the video for 3 seconds and then get to the correct answer. If it is a word, then it take around 6-7 seconds for me to speak out the answer. Is this speed okay or I need to be faster? Tip: If you're a complete beginner(with only certain words you know from anime) don't try to learn the whole script in an hour. Like please. Remember when in kindergarten you were taught the letters in English over a period of time? Maybe you won't need that long but divide it up. Like I started by learning the column with vowels and the k column along with dakuten/tenten the first day. I perfected the pronunciation as much as I could in a  day and then moved on to the next columns. Please don't try to rush the process. This took me 8 days to finish:) thanks for making it free

ありがとう ございます！₍ᐢ⑅•ᴗ•⑅ᐢ₎♡ But how to read every single word in Chinese pliz make vedio for Chinese language also 20:00 よくできました 丁度 Quick exercise if you finished this video: The poem "Iroha" is like our English "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", it has all the hiragana characters. So, try transcribing it to hiragana! (The original has both wi and we syllables, so I included the modern version as well, try both though because the new one is missing a few characters).

Old:
Iroha nihoheto
Chirinuru wo
Wa ka yo tare so
Tsune naramu
U wi no okuyama
Kefu koete
Asaki yume mishi
Wehi mo sesun

Modern:

Ui no okuyama

Copied from another comment Oh God.. writing ko(こ) like that is really difficult Just imagine writing an essay in Japanese. I wonder how they do it. Like if you miss one little line it could become a completely different word. It’s like a PIN .. I forget it after 5 seconds 😆🖊👴🏼 Fix yg bljr bhasa Jepang psti wibu the fact that me and my mom were talking about learning japanese and this pops up lol ive never watched any videos realted to this tf yt spying me lol Hiragana POV: youre learning this for: watching anime and satisfying your ego I'm don,t what that mean?what you write for? Y'all- I don't want to sound stupid, and yes I Google searched what imma ask but I still don't get it... What is the difference between hiragana, katakana, and kanji? And is learning hiragana alone enough? Step 1: Press down on the pen like you’re trying to turn the paper into diamonds. For anyone who is confused where is g,z,d,b,p here is the explaination -

Arigato I remember watching this video before learning Japanese I was so confused, and I look at it now and I’m like oh yeah 😭 MT obrigado, eu praticamente vejo anime o dia inteiro kkkkk, então pensei em juntar o útil ao agradável All i know is No bcz i always watch Doreamon and i saw No-bita so many time lol🤣🤣 0:19 ea sport to the game Hey your handwriting is so beautiful, cute and perfect it's like the printed letters.

My katakana: Ok (speed:normal)
My kanji: Ok (speed:fast)

I wrote chinese characters my whole life so I'm fine with kanji. Katakana uses parts of kanji/hanzi like エ(工)、ロ(口)、ハ(八)、イ(亻) 、ニ(二)、オ(才) so I'm familiar with the strokes. Hiragana is totally alien for me XD Japenese has no hu sound japenese has fu sound super..i am from sri lanka.thank you.best of iuck Do mo arigatho Gosimas sensea....✊ Kore musukashi na وييين حرف ال L؟؟؟؟ VietNam, Hà Nội, Tây Hồ.

1) anime
2) i want to confuse my friends and famliy
3) i can talk shit about anyone True dat Japanese are really so kind .. Thank you so much for this video, it was best among all videos I saw.......... so much love from India. Yes I’m bored  and I want something to confuse a friend so now I’ll be like talking in Japanese and my teacher like 👁👄👁 Thank you!! I learned a lot.. She is adorable Anime is the reason why I start learning Japanese Namma Pasanga yaarachu irukingala 😂😂 thank you! but it would be nice to add the words spelled next time cause I write them down to remember :) at this point, you can literally watch anime and learn all of this If someone can help me take care of my karen mother (not in emergency but emergency of danger pls) also ohio gozaimasu I can speak 2 languages on to Japanese now I love learning 😊 when you already know half of the words because of anime reasons i'm here:
-i want to surprise my Japanese friend
-so i can understand anime without subtitles
-so i can sing some of my favorite songs better I'm here just so I can confuse my friends and teachers in school. Sadly knew all this Am I the only one here not because of anime It would be better if you write these japanese words in English language then it would be easier for beginners to understand e.g. 
Thank you- Arigato
Good afternoon- Konnichiwa Im Turkish but I’m learning French , German , and English right now, I really wanna learn more languages ! Guys wish me luck, I’ll be back in a few months to update : ) Hi everyone! I am a Japanese American teenager (native speaker in Japanese) and I just made a discord server for Japanese learners to interact and help each other out. I am willing to help anyone who needs help & doing 1v1 session for FREE. 
CODE : JDqM66Ndbz i just want to learn how to speak japanese like an anime top comment: Anime brought you here
me: Kamen rider and ultraman brought me here I love how "with the audience" she is. Kinda reminds me of Dora the Explorer, , cuz she speaks to the audience as is they really were there. It also made me laugh. Really enjoyed it!! ^^ GOODMORNING Same Yoroshiko onegai shimasu I'm prolly gonna study this lesson for a week xD memory be bad 🇯🇵The easiest way to memorize hiragana (including practice sheet):
👉https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6TOvaoWkwM&list=PLDcijRxxjOPImBwjKNXehVqZ3EG64Oktb hi anime brought me here🌚 Idk why I’m watching this I’ve been studying Japanese for years Yeah I’m scared of all the anime people here am I the only one not here for anime *me not talking because im too shy to talk to myself and my parents are home* best teacher ever I repeat this video and other video 
Btw im new subcriber PLEASE THE LAST LNE IS SO HARD AND IM TOUNGE TIED 😿 ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑenquioññññññññ first time watching and i remembered 2 third of it 90 percent of people are here because of anime.. Phonetic spelling would have been useful Gozaimasu Sensei I like this I just want to watch anime without sub "Kimi wa hirō ni nareru"
"Zen shūchū mizu no kokyū"
"Kaminari no kokyū ichi no kata hekireki issen rokuren"

Sounds familiar right ? i’m just here so i can watch anime without dub, and also because im obsessed with japanese culture Thanks anime for bringing me here The reason im here is because i wanna go to japan one day and i wanna be able to communicate with people and understand what there saying I am here bcz of Jpop (FANTASTICS) ,I want to understand them speaking without subtitles 😆😆😂🤣🤣 Takeru Satoh's videos on YT brought me here. Majority don't have available subtitles >0<...So It's a long way to go but ...Ohayou gozaimasu! This is cool , i can learn very nice ✨🇯🇵 only here because I wanna move to Japan and drive around a R34 skyline This is not trailer. Dislike. 私はEmiliaです When she asked me do you remember goodmoring I laughed and said no. i love her!! arigatou sensei~ <3 and i wanna confuse my friends i am here because i love japaaaaan I’m here because I want to live in Japan one day and have a family over there thank you! i wanted to learn them soo much! but i am having hard time with the long sentences I wrote this down so when I go to Japan one day I will learn all of these languages but here comes the funny part when I am finally done with the lesson I showed it to my mom and I was like AHhhhH i’m finally done i’m FINALLY DONE!!!!

Thank you Mam damn i learn so fast thanks ♡ deym never thought konichiwa was good afternoon I thought it was hello the teacher is so cute <3 The audio quality is terrible, bad echoes making understanding difficult. Transliteration in Latin characters would make it marginally better. Guten naght The amount of times I've accidentally stabbed my self with my sharp pencil is just emasculate We're all here coz we love Anime ❤️7:03 11:25 I lost focus at 0:03 28:40 NANI?! ignore this

39:30 "A lot of expressions used in anime are not commonly used in daily conversations"
NANI?! こにちはみなさんぼくはすしがすきですさようならべいびー 43:40

marking my progress dont mind it I want to play yakuza without subtitles My dream is when I'm 18+ to start my life in Japan and be that aesthetic girl in Japan○v○ i just wnt to know this language The title is already a scam. Im learning japanese to watch anime without subtitles I want to learn japaneese language because  to watch anime POV: *ur learning for anime.* 12:08 Risa best girl Just a reminder for myself :) 
8:27 Bookmark 
Vowels: 8:13 Risa: Japan will host the 2020 summer Olympic games.

Coronavirus: I'm gonna stop you right there. Up until around the 40 minute mark. This just turned into listening practice for N4 and N5 Rather than teaching Basics.

Misleading title
For those who are just starting out, I'd recommend to watch another video that REALLY teaches the basics. 日本人としてはなんか半笑いになる動画やなｗ I know english, malayalam and hindi still I forgot anything in just 3sec 1% of people here are learning Japanese bcuz their parents force them

9% of people here are learning Japanese bcuz they want to 

90% of people are learning Japanese bcuz of anime and that included me I want to learn Japanese. But I kept on reading comments and get distracted. Hindi speakers will find japanese pretty easy : ) I'm learning japanese because i want to watch my favorite vtubers stream and be able to understand what they say. Who else is mad that iPad 17:50 why should you learn japanease?
ANIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im just here cause I want to watch anime without subtitles I have a dream to go japan With my family and settle with a nice job for lifetime. Thanks sensei 

ありがとう I'm learning Japanese for watching anime without subtitle :") Is it just me or that I am here to learn Japanese for watching Japanese cause I don't wanna watch anime with subtitles ani Learning Japanese for Anime 🤩🤩 so that I didn't waste my time on reading subtitles 🤣 It's easy for indian to pronounce japanese It's a fact you know I'm just here so i can watch anime without subtitles No Gabriella! I'm having a hard time! I'm ready to rip my hair out Gabriella! Help me Gabriella!!!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!! At first i think Japanese language is vary hard,but when i start to study i realized that this is the easiest language on earth! Everyone here for anime, I'm here because Dragon Quest X is never gonna be localized. When they're trying to teach Russian to say "R" like Japanese: *smort* Bro They Sound Like The Google Translation I was able to learn a little bit of Japanese thanks to Sonic, so learning the rest of it here. Why learn Japanese,because i want a Japanese girlfriend Anime why u should learn japanese:

To watch anime "Why learn a new language?"
Me:anime... I prefer Korean. Hey, i learned japanese. I’m now 18 and i’ve moved go Japan. :) Time stamp for myself 39:04 Me learning Japanese because: I HATE READING SUBTITLES! Oh and because I want to live there some day
I want to be prepared Trying to learn in order to read the rest of a manga which is written in Japanese :D No im not here for some damn anime, I just wanna know what "?" Means in Japanese someone already watch the full video?Is it worth the 4 hours really? Just came see the comments 27:00 34:21 Yes , it's so I dont need to read subs Me trying to learn japanese through a english lesson.🤯 I'm from germany :D What gets me is this is genuinely an interesting video to me, but because youtube took away the dislike count I can't tell if the 4 HOUR LONG video is a good watch.
I'll put this on my backlog to watch for now- And I'm here, someone who is a Spanish native speaker and learned English language and now it's using English language to learn Japanese language. It's a little crazy hahaha. 5:37 
Learn Japanese I came here cause an anime I like isn’t Sub . So I’ll do it … for my wifus Pls what is lesson 4😭😭 I'm here to learn Japanese not I don't know how to speak it すぐに日本語を学びました 🤣🤣🤣 why they go from pronouncing vowels to full on dialogues within 5 minutes The tough thing about Japanese is not the language...it is the pictograms they call an alphabet and the native speakers talk too fast... I am learning because no reason lol really irl More  like 2021 because covid "Arigatou"
The word "ri" is a mixture of R & L
Mean while in my language: This is the letter you supposed to pronounce it: ร
Ez
Edit: I felt kinda lucky that the language I learn since I was born has an similar pronunciation. As a spanish speaker it blows my mind how you have to explain the "r" sound or concept of subject omission, also in spanish more often than not we switch the order of the verb and the object just for convenience to answer a question like "que hiciste?" what did you do? "esto hice" this did, it is an answer with subject omission and reversed order xd Risa sensi😍😍 baka, kuso ....^^ Hello! I'm learning Japanese but I don't have practice enough, could anyone help me? I'm from Russia so I can help you with Russian or English language ;) [copied comment, keeping it here for myself so that I don’t lose it]

Me: learning Japanese. 

School: 😐 Reason I learning Japanese:
1. I like listening to mafu-mafu song, but I can't really understand anything anymore since YouTube remove community subtitle.
2. I already buy online concert ticket for HikiFes 2021, I want to understand what they are saying. 🥳🎉 I've been trying to learn japanese because my family is moving into japan next year. It would seem kind of rude if I just showed up to another country and expected them to speak my language. Since people are listing reasons here's mine :
Learn japanese so when im talking to myself outloud and someone hears me when i dont know they have no idea what im saying im studying Japanese for work I want to know Japanese,  but I don’t want to learn it. Nobody can learn Japanese. 30:35 43:38 [copied comment, keeping it here for myself so that I don’t lose it]

Plz tell me Unn
Unn~❤️ This was the cutest thing I’ve seen and it makes me miss Okinawa When I memories this 25 most common phase I thought that I could make a conversation but when I talk to my Japanese dad huhu Hai hai hai its always yes like when he ask me how much money do I want to have I reply hai its always yes because duhhhhhhhhhh japanese is harder than english paksh3t can you write them both out in normal text as you speak way too fast for a learner Btw, you can use はい when someone is speaking as "I understand, keep speaking"
and さよなら sounds like you're not going to see them for a long time, kinda like farewell. This was so helpful to me!It makes me remember more for some reason :0 thank you!! 2014 Risa uwu It’s so awesome that I can understand all of this Japanese is harder than Chinese Risa wa chikyū-jō de mottomo tanoshī hito no hitoridesu. My brain: how many do you want to remember?

Me: のん どうもありがとうございますリサー先生。 0:15 alright this is pretty easy

0:32 well...shit... Thanks this helped :) Risa is adorable NANII Thanks a lot for these Lively Lessons . Its very  interesting . My real challenge is,  trying to understand the  Casual Conversations . As ,mostly  the Verbs are  in  " te "  form, You have to be very sharp to Pick what they are  really  saying . I really Like the way Japanese People handle their Language .  And its very very interesting to see ,when teenage and  Young Japanese Girls ,speaks . They have a very beautiful rhythm .and Its really facinating . I learn Japanese in school but I forget the words like in 2 mins Too fast... I could not make out the first sounds in excuse me ☹️ You're so cuuuuuute!! Me:oyi oyi oyu Shes so fast :( 日本人だけど改めて日本語の難しさを感じたわ I subscribed ありがとうございます。 I think that it's so hard to learn Japanese 🙄 Risa, you are intoxicatingly beautiful, funny and sweet... I like Japanese language but learning their alphabets and grammar is so hard 😔 still stuck with Hiragana I can’t keep myself form thinking about Ash and Eiji when she says Sayonara As a beginner, can someone explain why the correct hiragana for “konnichiwa” is “こんにちは” rather than “こんにちわ”? ありがとございます！！！
Praying Tanaka will work hard to study Japanese. わたしすき君は
Can we write that for "l like you " ? Arigato Went from 0 - 100 really fast. RIP my dreams :( こんにちは  リサ 오하요 ohayo     good morning

oyasumi.  goid night
i just save this  Sentences ✔️🙃 You didn’t mentioned Ara Ara Yes it helps me so much My dream is to go to japan😢🖤🖤 Why is Japanese  words are not letters? ありがとうございます ありがと When you pronounce the words could you do a slow pronunciation. When said quick it’s hard to figure out what is exactly being said. I feel like if I hear a slower version I can practice saying it faster and more fluently :) All the effort in learning Japanese language is a waste of time.

Let’s talk about the big elephant in the room.

Japan is located in the earthquake zone. There will be a big earthquake, and this will be followed by a big tsunami. This will completely destroy most of the Japanese islands. The few remaining northern islands will be taken over by the North Korea. So maybe it’s better to learn North Korean.

How do you say goodbye in Japan.....

Ah . . . Sayonara. Yes I’m here cause I watch anime hood bye 5:00 Help! 🤣😂 Of you are here you watch anime I like to come your country people si want to stay there Thanks it will help me to see one punch man anima Risa is just... 😍 ありがと risa いいえ im gay here is the easiest way to learn japanese:

I think i will pro in japanese by watching this vedios within 6 months Me laughing as a Cantonese speaker and Chinese writer: why do all the cool sounding languages have a barricade
russian has the impossible to pronounce words
german has the sentenceswithnospacesmakingitnearlyimpossibletoread
and japanese has kanji, so you have to be an artist to say anything I just want to read manga without translation...but turned out that kanji is hard asf Just memorize them. If you are really that curious about how these kanji came from, learn Chinese and you'll see the origins of each kanji. I wish I have sharingan so I can just copy that Kanji HAHAHAHAHA Lol nice video but i spek spanish and dont undersant english but i like lto learn japanese i understand nothing and with subtitules is difficult . They could not make videos like that but in Spanish to be able to learn English. Thank you for your attention. me: tries to learn kanji
my brain:の For a mandarin  Chinese native like me, Kanji is really friendly. I recognize kanji but just not sure about the pronunciation. I am here after learning hiragana and katakana thinking kanji ll be a piece of cake....... Well... Why is kanji so hard bro like just use A-Z why do they need sooo many 😭😭 I can see why 憂鬱 means depression because I got depressed after trying to write it. I dont get how 正午 means noon but in here they just show 午。。。 魑魅魍魉 2:03 the mark of the raging demon... I still don't know the difference between kanji and katakana why sun/day + man = reflection? doesnt make sense. I thought "person+tree" is monkey. Very good explaining Okey.... i love this comment section, but it also scares me... a just finished learning Hiragana and Katakana.... oh... the things I do for watching anime without subtitles.... here I go with Kanji! wish y'all the best of luck! My brain when i want to learn kanji: の





Also my brain: ノ 24:25 just think of it as Phineas as a child guys The number of kanji that we Japanese usually use. 1,300. （＾ω＾ ）
The number of Chinese characters in Chinese. 200,00,000. (´・ω・`) English  and other European languages are written in Roman Latin alphabet. In some cases modified for sounds absent in the Roman phonetic system. Me looking at the older brother kanji without knowing the name taking a guess: 
It must mean jaw! Mouth support, could be like a jaw! 
No it means older brother?? hiragana and katakana: 🤗⭐️:D fullmetal alchemist :D⭐️🤗

kanji: 👹 *F U L L M E T A L A L C H E M I S T* 👹 I really thought knowing chinese helps but no it's honestly more confusing bc they are completely different when pronouncing. Imma mix the two up Japanese Kanji: Hey y'all need to learn at least 2,000 characters to be fluent.
Chinese Hanzi: that's cute. Other people saying that they started with hiragana and katakana but......




I started out with kanji This is very good learning ”fairly simple"
嘘である Math addition: 1+1=
Me: Oh! Oh! It's simple! 2. 
In words: person+words=?
Me: 👁️👄👁️

Done with hiragana and katakana and kanji is waving at me! Plot twist: they are just stuck standing there teaching, thats why they dont change clothes in every lessons 🤣🤣🤣 People in the comments seeing Kanji: What form of sorcery is this?
Me, a Chinese seeing Hiragana and Katakana: How do you even read that? wish me luck mfs. also the 2 ways of reading kanji makes me wanna die, as if writing it wasnt hard enough Master Risa, there are too many of them! What are we going to do? You are awesomeあ 漢字の読み方がわかりました。ありがとうございます! ur not japanese so why ppl watching this vid 20:20 older brother .. mouth and human legs (had a picture of memes flashing in the brain ) Mye Engelishi ise welly goodtho  :::::
 I thought something like that how Japanese people speak English 🤣🤣🤣 but I was wrong :
His engilshe isu welly perfacto just looking at a preschool 1st grade kanji 
gave me headache Kanji കഞ്ഞി  മലയാളം Malayalam language means  Porridge 7:33 As someone who knows Chinese,
1:14 basically reads:
*“sī wa supōtsu ga hao ki desu.”* How to differentiate between the mouth radical and the ロ(Ro) Day 1 : 26:50 When they say radicals are easier than memorizing the kanji as is but then kanji radicals is just math radicals =both as hard and doesnt make sense i think im gonna have a stroke just by learning stroke orders. can you teach us how to say " please stop!!! " in japanese 9:25 seriously I can't understand what's the meaning of readings in this context. What do the symbols above the "3 people" symbols mean at 9:43? This video really help me, to learn japannese language, *me still trying to figure out how to use the Japanese keyboard on my iPad* 古 The japanese really woke up and said lets make kanji. A complete mouth is old, dry, and hard xD Japanese got real creative lmao No one: me being a spanish person trying to undertand the inglish for know what the are saying for undertand japanese😐 Kanji is Chinese? Why don't they replace kanji with emojis. I mean why?

Won't you🧠 this 📝:
I am a 🧒. I am ✍️ing this to make you 👁️ the fact that emojis are 👍. In fact 1️⃣can 🗣️ a lot with this technique. I don't 😡 🇨🇳and🇯🇵. But this seems 👌. Why❌ try this.

Ik I went to far but still superb Having a bright and colorful imagination helps with learning kanji. Doesn't really make sense when you consider japan encourages unity and everyone being the same 同じ how the hell mouth + "support" / legs makes older brother, wtf Anyone learning Japanese for travel, books and movies instead of just anime? I feel lonely. Maybe I shouldn't have skipped my japanese classes... Imagine Japanese Kindergarten learn all of this.... My goshhhh... Kanji makes my life more complicated 😵😵😵😵😱😱🤧🤕🤕😅😅😅 I can't.. That tiny lil gap tho. Lol In japan are there any Lisas? Or are they all named Risa? リサかわいいです "This kanji is made from two radicals: person and tree."
Oh, so it means lumberjack?
"A person under a tree is resting, so it means resting."
Oh... Ok, I have to think deeper into it, got it. Let's try the second...
"This kanji is made from two radicals: person and trunk. The trunk is like the tree, but has a cut."
I knew it! This one is lumberjack, right?
"A person's trunk is their body, so it means body."
Oh c'mon...
"Differently than previous characters, the meaning of the human legs radical is less literal"
Oh gosh thanks, I was worried it was all going to be that easy Advice that helped me learn. Kanji is similar to the diverse meanings behind emojis. For the Human Legs Radical, in mandarin it can be a stand alone kanji that means child or kid 儿 (er) which I thought would've meant that in Japanese it would also mean the same thing, but apparently in Japanese this just has no meaning. Me learning Kanji for a year.
This fokin video : 45 minutes Bi*ch. "Learn Kanji in 45 minutes" yeah right. More like learn kanji in 45 years... 🥰❤🍱🍙🍘🍚🍜🍛🍝🍠🍥🍤🍣🍢🥠🥡🦞🦀🦐🦑🍡🥟🦪🍺🍽❤ Kanji ft. Imagination
*Me with zero imagination: tf we want more kanji videos. 31.00 personal timestamp Hi. So I'm self-learning Kanji and I don't know how to. Like, the word Sensei [せんせい] has a kanji (先生) I think it's Xiansheng? So, before I thought kanji are words that sound similar to how the japanese words are pronounced, but apparently it's not - instead, are they actually different words that have their own meaning as *teacher* ? So, when we read a japanese sentence, is it okay if we don't remember the chinese pronunciation but recognize the kanji as Sensei? Or should we also memorize the chinese pronunciation too? So madam did learn Japanese before we need learn Chinese it my doubt next Chinese and kanji same sounds or means or both same ? ah yes legs can also mean to see I get it that's easy. A word of advice people: don't try to understand the association of the radicals, just use it as a mnemonic or as a mental note to remember those kanjis. Useful THINGS I DO FOR ANIME (1) learning Japanese:
Hiragana: easy
Katakana: hmm kinda easy?
Kanji: お前はもう死んでいる
i won’t be writing Kanji, i will draw Kanji writing kanji notes using a mechanical pencil is the greatest decision i've made in my life I think my biggest take from this video is that the only rule to learning kanji is to use your own imagination when memorizing each kanji. If you try to make up a rule to learn them all you will just screw yourself. Great video. 人 is easy for me because it reminds me of 사람 which means person yep this is all bs.. I never thought learning kanji would be so interesting, now I'm excited to learn more, thanks to this channel. You think Kanji is difficult? That's because you were(most likely, since you're learning it) not brought up in Japan and have not had much interaction with the japanese language since birth.
It's easy for us to say that english isn't difficult because it's everywhere in everything we do, books, games, music, movies etc.. English would be very complicated for a newcomer without any prior experience with the language. Take this sentence as an example;

"Soldiers, in order to restore order(Chitsujo) to the world, I hereby order(Meirei) you to order(Chuumon) medicinal supplies and hand them out to people in the following order(Junban?); Sickly, Kids, Adults. That is all, dismissed."

Same word, four different meanings. If you think kanji is complicated, how do you think someone that wasn't essentially brought up with english would feel reading that sentence? very helpful episode learn for kanjiso hello and good afternoon is the same  I love the phrase I don't speak Japanese because your using Japanese to say I don't speak japanese yeah pretty much. when i was just starting to learn Japanese, i kept making the mistake of saying the "u" sound lol but now i know not to do that :D so the u is silente? rly helps! ; )What is fonts for?

9:26 this is useful i like it Osm explained sir tqu so much 🙏 Arigatou I love it I feel like japanese people writing english is better than my own writing, maybe it's because their writing system is just so much more complex. Русские? Japanese is little similar to indian languages only pronounciation 素敵な仲間は外国人を教え続けます Wow.. Very good teacher!
I'm now motivated to learn Japanese language.
It's very similar to Swahili language except the symbols.
Japanese alphabets are exactly like Swahili alphabets but writen in symbols.
Anyone who speaks Swahili can easily learn Japanese language. Lol I already know this but i'm just revising cause i'm gonna learn katakana/kanji now..wish me luck and hopefully it won't be harder than I think :< Hiragana was surprisingly easy though..

The only katakana characters I know atm are 先生,学生 and 願😂😂🤣✌️🏼 i really took the time to write down all of this knowing my lazy ass probably wont study Muchisimas  Gracias es lo que estaba buscando!

Normal people: こんにちは
Me, an intellectual: ひ This was the first video I’ve watched about learning Japanese, and I’m not even going to LOOK at other videos. This was so fun to watch People in 2021 are really a legend.
😁😁😁😁❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍


Any legends???😁😁😁😉😉😉 Saw myself imitating you with a loud laugh at the ending when you said “ge n ki desu ka”...Really awesome and amazing way to teach🤣. Life is Hard Already, Teachers should learn to add some spice to it in the Classroom or wherever🙏🏽😇 I LOVE THIS CLASS This was fun!😃 When she asked, genki desu ka? I answered saiaku desu Hmm the ending "ka" in Japanese language that might be the origin the ending "kah" in Indonesian.

"Gengki Des ka?" 
Means how are you.
"Gengki des"
Means "good" / "gengki" / "healthy"

Indonesian,
"Sehat kah?"
Means "are you well?"
"Sehat"
Means "I'm well" / "Well"

Reply to see if I actually kept my word ニコ Free? Joshua 
ジョシュア I believe my name "James" in Katakana would be ジェームス.  Is that correct? What the fck is kanji and katakana for when you can easily write with hiragana and put a space between each word? 

Japanese is weird 47:55 Only 2 from 7 million people can make through Hiragana lesson. you guy are qualified. 48:28 Shiva in Katakana is "シヴァ" ミゲル ありがとう  りさ せんせい 32:43 Just a suggestion, but I think instead of using a "house's roof" for "ha", we could also use "a hot volcano", since the pronounciation is more similar to "ha" Duolingo is so hard bless you Risa sensei Quiz Time:

I keep hearing "yo quiero que mashita" 私はクリパプリンズです。 ギルレミ Is there any way to pronounce ' Lo ' or ' la ' or anything that starts with an L following it a vowel in Japanese? ありがとございます❣️ I’m not even gonna lie this is 100x faster then duolingo 46:09 Now I'm confused...

at least I think so lol インストラクターは美しい女性です 私の名前はイルヴァです。Did I do it right? 6:55 30Min - 1 hour h for Katakana and Hiragana. 
Easy... It's creepy that the more I get happy that I learned katakana, the more terrifying kanji looks to me. My name vijay when translate Into japanese bijei it showing 😂🤣 I can remember ko, na and even the ー extending vowel thing easily because my name is Japanese is コナー. I have hiragana down, time for katakana... i hope i don't forget everything i just learned though. i love the subtle jabs she makes at weebs LMAO 4:00 remember aaron😂 Please make this video child friendly there are some inappropriate words the way she says okay... ok I am down. I am gonna learn all of the japanese. I noticed that some Japanese words use characters from both hiragana and katakana, why not just use all katakana characters for the words? I noticed that some of the words used characters from hiragana and katakana, why not just use katakana symbols for the entire word? フリダ　:) ダラ Hi my name is Kieran, would I spell it how it sounds like this キラン, or would I include the エ to write it like this キエラン My name is Stephen Levi Stepanian  so I guess setefen rivai setepanian Thank u soo much for ur examples to read characters help me a lot to learn hiragana and katakana ❤🙏 arigatogozaimasu risa sensei Risa taught me hiragana.

(copied from other comment 4 me) 22.28 whoever decided to do this should be killed Bookmarks -
Day 1 : 20:00 , Day 2 : 47:56 , Day 3 : 1:1:33 Finally done with katana And hiragana 😩🙏🏼 This beautiful women's done it. After struggling on Duolingo this is just perfect. Wow. 20:33 for me lol "you've now mastered 51 japanese characters"
WHAT THE FU- Next episode: Learn ALL Kanji in 1 Hour - How to Write and Read Japanese I saw the katakana ‘ta’ as the tiTAnic sinking. Was that just me? After learning both Hiragana and Katakana, theres this final boss named Kanji Risa: "You've now mastered 86 Japanese characters."
Me: ﾉ Yep...hiragana was easier to remember than katakana -_-. 
I always get the Katakana symbols mixed up during Quiz Time and on Duolingo. I am romanian and for me, it's very confusing because we have a group of letters: gi, ge, ghi, ghe that are pronounced differently from ぎ げ. 

 ぎ is writen gi but in my language sounds like a ghi and the same for げ is so confusing!! ひらがな？ カタカナ
漢字 risa sensei is the best teacher✨ I learned hiragana in 1 week  but I cant seem to memorize Katakana. Whyyyy 😨 Now im scared of Kanji! Why for cheese at 26:26 its "chi su" not "chi ju" in pronounce Why the hiragana he and katakana he are the same? THANKYOU SO MUCH RISA YOU MAKE LEARNING SO EASYYYY 私は日本人じゃありません
But love japan and japanese

Hope this helps HOW IS THIS FREE OMG!!! she even showed hiragana for us not to forget ナイス! YOU ARE THE BEST SENSEI Just finished mastering 100% hiragana, that's gonna be fun! I'm Japanese.
Why am I watching this video?/ 31:17 Nico nico nii!!! Title:-Learn ALL Katakana in 1 Hour
Me:- *Taking 1 Month to Learn* Risa sensei i kinda mastered hiragana im ready for katakana Хммм, много ли русских изучает японский вместе со мной? Сколько лайков - столько русских смотрит это видео! Risa: NIKO NIKO
Weebs: NIKO NIKO NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINotification Squad: Well guys, I hope you enjoyed watching me make an absolute idiot of myself. I’ve decided my new goal in life is to be able to read Harry Potter in Japanese - it’s the dream I never knew I wanted. As I said at the end, the whole experience reignited my passion for learning Japanese - a passion that’s been replaced by studying filmmaking over the last 2-3 years instead.  I’m considering taking JLPT1 (N1) next year though, in which case, I’d better hurry up and get studying.
A huge thanks to the five students who opened up about their experiences studying at a Japanese language school and a big thanks to Go! Go! Nihon for getting us access inside to film!
Definitely check them out if you’ve ever thought about trying a Japanese language school - you never know where it may lead!
Go! Go! Nihon: http://bit.ly/GoGoNihonAIJ 'it was the perfect introduction.... except I forgot my name' BEST PART OF THE VIDEO this was soo fun chris!! loved how fun and chill everyone was!! poog :DD Jack sparrow?? 7:19: "Wakarimasen".
Subtitles: I have no idea
Me: Its: I dont know but its the same Abroad in Japan, with Broad Chris “Encourage to come to Japan” …isn’t this contradictory to some of your top videos? Wait-wait-wait-wait, stoooopppp!!!
is that really a beginner classsss???? :D

I am doomed.... :-p I know this is stupid but I searched up Sendai, Japan and it is exactly 6,969 miles from me (hehe nice) I'm still confused how a begginer class student should already know how to read kanji and understand paragraphs in japanese, then how is it in the intermediate class Honestly, I found the Abroad channel later than most of the fans here, and even then I navigated around this video until today.  I was pleasantly surprised how helpful it was.  Now I just need to wait for the [Trademarked International Athletic Competition] to finish up, so that I can see about getting to class in 2022.  Now, to see about a loan for all that cheddar I'll need for the tuition... Can you make video about: building materials and tools. Just small video i want see difference between EU and Japan. We had the same task with the married couple and their trash issue :P Whoa, I just noticed from the entry requirements sheet towards the end of the video the school has an AGE requirement, you cannot be over 45!!! I just turned 48. Wtf..... Dude …. 😂 how many adults would be able to go back to grade school and do the work i wounder ^_- Makes a lot of sense for a beginner level class in any foreign country, when I moved to Switzerland I took an integration course and language class and every single thing was in German.
If you're actually trying to make a living in a foreign country or even simply trying to learn the language, they're not going to baby you and try to teach you how at a snail's pace as most of the online courses or classes in high schools across the US do.
To truly understand any language it takes a lot of practice and a lot of patience of which can be helped and in some cases even somewhat accelerated by immersing yourself in a culture where you cannot speak your native tongue. Your voice would be perfect to narate movies. I could listen to you for hours. Thank you, I'll be looking into this with high hopes 😊 Chris should work with Ken Watanabe. Also, all eyes are on him. Clearly a high school romcom protag Holy sht he looks like jack sparrow's cousin nah cause girl at 2:00 real pretty i need that @ 😭🤝 ..and youll end up coming here when you are 30!!! LOLOL SO OLD LIFE IS OVER I am not supposed to do it at 60 because the American guy thinks being 30 Is OLD???? That’s entry level !! 12:12 Куплинов, ты что здесь забыл Maybe asked before but what level is this? Seems like mid-intermediate. What's the name of this language school? can weseeyouwalkthrough a door? like homersimpson does 6:57 . The  fretful kettledrum postmeiotically breathe because manager histomorphometrically signal a a sincere particle. spiky, milky orange This video gave me the push to enroll myself into a Japanese Language school in the same year, 2019. And that experience has by far been the best experience of my life. So, thank you! (I guess) :-) 2:46 Harry puta ahaha tangina XD @Abroad in Japan "[...] watching me make an absolute idiot of myself." DO NOT SAY THIS! If you would perfect there, you would be grown up as a Japanese. No one is perfect. Like me in english. I say to myself, yes, I can English. But no, I can't. I can clearly understand but I can't write perfect and even more less speak. I dunno why. You are a nice person who are still learning. Everyone is still learning. The entire Life is a learning process. So, I respect you and everyone else should do, too. Oh and BTW: Watch out for "88 - Pilgern auf Japanisch". Sadly it is only in German language but for sure with engl. subtitles. It is the Japanese "Way of St. James" and the discriptions says: "The Way of St. James is good and beautiful. But here comes the latest pilgrimage - the Way of St. James to the power of two: the hachijuhakkasho, the path of 88 holy places, which circles the Japanese island of Shikoku. Because of the many temples, shrines and monks, the Japanese call it the holy island. People have been making pilgrimages there for twelve hundred years, along a route of 1,300 kilometers, marked by 88 temples. Anyone who goes here is Japanese and a Buddhist. Only very rarely does a foreigner mix with them." So, there you can see: No one is perfect! ^_~ teacher:- waht is your name?

Student:- gives his entire life history except name 🤣🤣🤣 i notice the asian guys in a white t shirt has a tatoo, so japanese schools does not discriminate people with tats? You have a Japanese moustache superb editing, Very nice! Thank you for sharing, good video Good God you are so look like Paulo Dybala Begginers class looks really hard lol. I just realized Chris is left handed. i wanted to apply to this school but it has very bad reviews on google "My advice is to just go for it and get out of your comfort zones"

Cries in being a poor highschool student. Them teacher be good looking I can understand Japanese but can't read it 😕 Damn! That teach is great! Seems like a fun class :-) I guess “Tawapon” was a thai guy name. 😁 The way Chris is writing is giving me anxiety. Ahahaha, i am almost 30. XD and I want to go there xD 12:10 This section made me feel good. 
Seeing older people still going for their dream and doing things for their live. 
I have a lot of problems and I feel old even if I am 'just' 29 but it made me feel really good to see that second person at 50 still going to the language school and doing something new. 

Oh yes psychological problems.. you never know what you take for granted before you lose it. Has anybody told Chris before how adorable he is by being so awkward? Anyway, I wanted to add that I got so touched they offer such great services to people who want to make a new chapter in Japan. I'm touched because it truly is a great soul journey to actually live in another country, with the good & the bad of course. Life lessons are our own treasures <3 Is he just a YouTuber now ? Does he not do any other job  ? This was absolutely brilliant. More resources that will help open the door to visiting and living in Japan. Thank you for sharing, Chris-san. Great video but for me this would just be terrifying haha school anxiety vibes So if you are over 45 you can’t enroll? The flaky cup immunophenotypically compete because friend objectively walk pace a naive bengal. tasteful, general gentle relation I know this is a dumb question but I don't know how to talk much Japanese, only words not full fledged phrases yet but if I do go into one of these schools are they going to understand that I cannot do complete phrases, read or write? "Begginers class" also everyone 

Speaks Japanese like it's nothing I should go to these schools 😶 That beginners class teacher seems really fun and cool to learn from! does the website kinda like help sort like how to making a living during the months taking classes? Bruh i jus wanna learn jp cuz subs are damn boring to read and inaccurate The most effective way to learn Japanese is textbook, coffee, quizlet, Japanese discord server. Revisiting this a year a year later as a fan that rewatches videos regularly I would love to see another video like this one again. After the  journey across Japan 3 series finishes up. NICE VIDEO

良い動画！いいね！👍 My dream, just like my original  language. I hope i have one in the future chris! Damn, I want to study at this school now terrible pronunciation. forget about that! i wanna see a day in this british dude's life look at that smirk fat This video changed my life. Thanks bro I remember the same was in my french class, chinese girls knew already some french, n me I was like knowing nothing ^^ , and teacher just started talking in french, I was petrified lol n embarrassed I attend japanese class every sunday in a city hall here in japan This happened to me once which still gets me. I’m the person who hates being called on all my classes...
But one day ouch 😣 
Teacher: eyes scrolling the classroom “ who should I pick next?”
Me: don’t pick me.
Teacher: picks me.
Me: simply answered IDK. * it worked all the time until....”
Teacher: looks at my paper. “ what you mean you don’t know? You got your answer right on the paper.
Me: oh crap.... busted. It's remind me when i studied Thai language in Bangkok for almost two years, what a great experience 😀😀 I decided Japanese not to get a job but to be self employed 🥂 so obsessed with Japanese language and culture we do didnt even have books or computers at that time ...I fed my curiousity for Japanese through world books were all that existed was some old anciet hiragana texts ....the rest is now history but the journey continues ....all the love and hugs to all persuing the Japanese language 💕👏🤗 日本人は口閉じて食うのがマナーやから口閉じて食べてって言うのはおk? Very cool video wow, remember when you could go to japan? poxy covids ruined *everything* This man is teasing us by calling his skills "lackluster". Honestly would love to, and want to live and work in japan... Just leaving things behind and getting setup correctly in Japan with necessary health care is extremely daunting 14:32 or else you keep putting it off and before you know it you're 30. Me, a 30 year old *hmm I should probably stop putting it off* kore wa pen des!!!! I see you're left handed... Do you find it difficult to write because maybe your flow of writing differs from someone who is right handed? I experienced a lot of trouble learning to write in Chinese because each character has a flow order and I had a hard time abiding by it because my nature I write everything backwards because of my left handed ness... Just wondering if it's the same. Nope It must have been so awkward when he just introduced himself and then sensei asks about his info to the whole class. Haha and the cam is rolling. 1:58 the girl thought the guy was going to murder her LOL "You keep putting it off then you end up coming here when you're 30" 
> is almost 30 🥴 3:36 I knew he was Korean just by looking at him lol The nine question genomically yell because office sadly float against a shocking mall. protective, giddy underwear Poor chris "Otherwise they will forget the 2000+ kanji "
Oho, Chris, about Chinese... that flexing 4:10 that school bell gave me ptsd I feel like Chris is a sort of person who would light a building on fire and just watch it burn. Covid-19 Olympics still on going sad You look a bit japanese. Let's take one minute of silence for those who have buttoned everything up to conquer Japan in 2020.. if i had the money trust me i would go and do it! i know saving up is key but it takes time and who knows down the line if i still wanna do it and change my mind which i hope i won’t!To all Japanese learners, don't forget to download your Free JLPT N5 Cheat Sheet including the 103 Kanji you must know, vocabulary, grammar and more: https://goo.gl/BdQNcC 🎓 2013 RISA SENSEI AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Why is "shun" written in Katakana? so lets try this,  hajimemaste  watashi wa aditya desu, adi to yonde kudasai

Thanks for your efforts Thanks はじめまして。わたしわルシアです。よろしくおねがいします。 I was wondering if it would be okay to asked to be called by my first name after introducing myself since my last name is very long and a mouthful.

She says to practice with Japanese friends.... I don't have one
And if you don't have one, she says to practice here in the comments.... so, why there's no one making that? Lol
Anyways Shun's voice sounds like someone from the UA Sumimasen, Hajimemashite, watashi wa _____ desu. De mo ____ to yonde kudasai. Yoroshko onegaishimas. question, what's the difference between kanji and hiragana, and what are both generally used for? i really love the pod101 channel...once i started learning hebrew...with hebrewpod 101...and they were teaching really nice..but i couldnot continue...but now im starting with nihongo..wish me luck guys!! Thank teacher for sharing Love your effort in each and every one amongst hundreds of you other videos. It must be hard to sit in a room and keep on teaching each and every alphabets in a phrase for hours and not look tensed up or stressed out. Great respect to you and your channel. Keep doing your best thank you again!! Miasa nihongo benkiou shimasu! I always studying nihongo i love this way to learn japanese thanks hijimashima wadasiwa richard this U should not concentrate on plane concentration on japanese learning 'hajini maste'  'watashi wa rusu jazumin - des' 'Jaz tu yundekudesai'
This is cuz it said go practise with your japanese friends . . . but guess what . . . I DONT EVEN HAVE FRIENDS- Idk if anyone can answer this for me, but I always get confused about stating my name! Is it okay to say “Watashi no namae wa Raven desu”. Or just leave it as “Watashi wa Raven desu”? It forgot to mention that watashi is only for females. If you’re a male then you say boku instead when introducing and referring to yourself.

It's bagas hadi pratama. Am i have to say my full name or only my first/last name? えぐいくらいハッキリ発音するんだな...
日本の英語のリスニングテストとかもネイティブにとってはこんな感じに聞こえるのかな 1:45 the caption so wrong. Mark definitely did not say "Hi! How are you? I'm Mark.
He instead said " Nice to meet you! I'm Mark. I'm not even Japanese and i caught that. 

You also have to account that i learned most of my Japanese from this channel. learn Japanese should be proud of their student. Domo arigato gozaimasu. I am really amazed at the wondrous art of presentation that made me fascinated to know Japanese people, culture and language and also to have friends from Japan. If anybody comes forward with great heart, she will be welcomed warmly.

*itadakimasu* Japanese have three Scripts
1. Hiragana
2. Katakana
3.Kanji
The main differences are that hiragana is used for phonetically spelling out Japanese words, and katakana is for foreign words. ... Kanji is not a phonetic syllabary. Instead it is a set of characters that represent whole words. mee Wow this is kinda easy now, I have a tip for u guys if you want to learn, you can listen too this (without looking) and try to spell the non Kanji ones on paper, It helped me lol Jaoanese is the best and very easy 6:44 Oh my flipping lord how much japanese do I have to write in my sketchbook (nobody is forcing me im actually forcing myself😂) Who else is taking notes 📝

Arigato gozaimasu sensei Very useful, but there are a lot of repeats. The video would be even more useful if you broke it down to like 30 minutes videos and arrange the expressions around different subjects. Like weather, introductions, etc. Thank you so much! :) I'm learning so I can work in Japan soon! Help me out to learning Japanese
Simply and easy to say in japanese language 51:48 私は家で日本語を勉強します、ありがとうございます！(I study Japanese at home, thank you!) It’s a great video.
I upload short video with Japanese and English everyday.
I hope that will help you to learn Japanese and Japan.
My name is Jiro from Wakayama Japan. Why does the video say 'Konnichiwa', when Japanese people write it 'Konnichiha'? i love japenese im going to japan to get a job and to live and discover new things I hope all the foreigners watching this video will be able to speak Japanese well. Keep learning!! Very good Konnichiwa ありがとう！また明日(^▽^)o JUST SAY HELLO TO JOHN
i mean- 
ジョンに挨拶する Hello Kendra, i am a little confused about how many ways there are to say the same thing. For example to ask "How are you" and "How do you feel"... You give many sentences, but i feel lost with these similar expressions. You understand? Thank you for this video it was very helpful. What does 後ろを見て mean? I'm here so I could have conversation with Japanese in pubg Thanks for this vid!

debug:
251: The romaji is wrong... should be 'ippon', not 'ichi hon'. I’m going Japan in 2-3 years in exchange so I wanted to learn but I realized no other method for learning works better for me than listening. And that’s exactly how I learned English cause when I was a baby my parents would talk French mostly (my first language, Canadian) but a lot of English and by just listening and watching I learned in a year or so. That’s why I say I was kind born knowing English because since birth I knew it. After I can hold a basic conversation I’ll get to learn to write which is quite easy for me but I’m still practising kanji, romanji, and english. Perfect <3 Great work. It would be cool though, to have the text as a word file 🤣 ありがとう 日本語は難しい！！ Im here because i wanna show my weeb friends that i can speak japanese after pandemic 😴🤙 Excelent! This video is just right for beginners. It’s nice and slow that makes it easy to follow. i hope it will absorb  in my braim beginning this day this is my everyday  listening  task こんにちは、元気ですか? Are there downloadable flash cards that are a companion with this video? perfect 私は英語を勉強するのにこの動画を使ってます！

Yes she look a little bit like Hitomi Tanaka Love this please leave Romaji on it. I know many say that it’s not the best and many should be able to read already realistically everyone is at a different part of their language journey and it helps to make it accessible straight away. 良いところ: 皆んなは社会ルールをちゃんと守る、周りの人間に迷惑をかけない
悪いところ: 上下関係が厳しすぎ、いじめ問題は大変 Today i learned how to read romanji and english at the same time すごい 😍 You are very very much Great media これはまだ難しです。簡単じゃない思ういます So everyone in Japan does look like anime characters I am reading aloud scary stories in Japanese.
My Youtube channel name is "岡 勝秀の 怖い話の朗読".
I hope you enjoy it. Thank you 🙏🏻 To everybody trying to learn japanese: がんばって the English subtitles are distracting, making them optional would be better. after 2 years spent time to learn japanese, I realized Japanese is too difficult. Everyone should think carefully before learning japanese. I don't know why japanese has made their language to be too difficult いいところですよね。私は仙台市に行ったことがあります。 1:44 FBI Open up!! I learnt a new word "KANPEKI"- "PERFECT" 8-) これ難しいんじゃないの？w
日本人だけど、日本語の規則性の無さを感じた Прыкольно 思いやり、👍 i recently started learning Japanese lol Wow so fast it says easy japanese, but native speakers talk really fast it's so hard to follow hahaha Omg that reporter is so waifu. をwてぃしっそへlpふぃのwぇあrねdじゃぱねせ！ 20 years ago, when I got my first English class at school, I said one day I will understand and speak this language so easily that even I will be surprised. I got 8 on ielts academic lately. Now , here I am ,33 years old mother. One day I will speak and read Japanese naturally. I hope it won't take 20 years this time 🤭 Awesome 👏 _ liked 👍 _ & subscribed ✅ Started learning japanese today. Day1. What better motivation than watching this video..😀😀 全然簡単じゃなくて草 i don't know why it's called "easy japanese" 😵 i had a really difficult time catching up International space border need our future for security of Earth 🌎 I understand nothing but i loved watching this 😍😘 love from india More like Advanced Japanese... But anyway, great channel and videos. Helped me a lot though i still can't even fully get it. That's supposed to be an easy one?? Ooops 1:24 lol the guy's wearing a mask, thought it was shot recently, but saw "6 years ago" below the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwxRvwWRtQ https://youtu.be/4VnNCxS0s5g https://youtu.be/4VnNCxS0s5g 仙台の人ってこんなに標準語なんだ

Thank you very much The girl who mentioned "Haikyuu" ....the best 0:30 oniçiva oniçiva I'm always surprised, when asking about Anime, nobody ever talks about 攻殻機動隊 (Ghost in the Shell).  I think is the best Anime ever made. More than 20 years later... its still so cool, yet accurate to this day. This helped I am a Filipino and teaching English  to Japanese professionals. This channel is very helpful to my job. I am a very   big fan of Japan that's  why I started  collecting some Japanese staffs. And i decided to create  my channel(beginner)  to show how much i appreciate their food nature and stories. ベトナムごがあったらよくなるですけと。 I'm Japanese.this is no easy Japanese.it's very difficult. For a first encounter with Japanese, this is completely over the top. Please looks at "Easy Russian". There a beginner can follow. Your inter view style and the speed is appropriate for a more advanced student. Great idea but poorly executed. Maybe you need a Easy Japanese 0 series. In many a YouTube video in the Japanese language, I hear the term sounding like ess-keh-doh.  What does it mean? リポーターさんちょっと下手w

#Reject military. Normal Japanese すねえ Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru 0:38　魚だったらやっぱりねwww Yang sayang aku like yang cinta allah coment What's so great about Japan? Fish. Y’all I totally forgot about this channel. I think I watched this even before I started my otaku journey skfjks someone pls teach me😔✊🏻 Holy shit they actually look like anime characters プリキュアアアアア Old people: manners
Young people: Anime 😔 I am happy I can understand 80% of this after four months of learning! If i had to describe this language id say it was crisp and beautiful. The way every word has distinct pronunciation and a nice flow to it. Sounds so cool, I'm starting to learn and look forward to being able to one day speak it fluently! at 00:27 why does she say literally: "kyou wa desu ne" - "it's today ("..., right?", "..., agree?", etc) " instead of just: "kyou wa" - "today" or "for today"? i’m so glad someone said haikyuu !! (: So happy to see a video in Tohoku!!! Also, the Purikyua guys made me cackle. I watched the Mandarin series and then I came to this just to see what the Japanese is like. I've been in Japan over a decade, and I live in the area this was shot, so I understood the whole thing. Some thoughts for beginners. 
1. Japanese is probably not very suited for this style of video. There are 3+ politeness levels in Japan, so the language the interviewer uses when approaching people is in the polite realm and not something people would know. 
2. Slang and dialects. This video is shot in the north and nobody has a super-strong accent to my ears, but it is different from Tokyo. However the way people speak in general, there are a lot of times that Japanese shorten the dictionary forms in everyday conversation. Like they say, "anma" instead of "amari" in this video. I teach Japanese now and I don't think I have ever seen "anma" in a textbook. Also, Japanese has a lot of speaking styles. Like, from the perspective of both vocab and style, the old guys speak different from old women, speak different from young people, speak different from high schoolers. Probably the easiest to understand is that first lady who likes rice. 
So, after all of that, this style of video is probably best suited for someone who has a good base of textbook or basic conversation, who is trying to learn what real Japanese is like. 1:29 i can't see the shinigami behind him 俺の日本語の話すのできるの男先生と羨ましいだから、もっと日本語を勉強したいけど、私の日本語スキルがまだ基本の級です。 The most easy language i ever learn after english In the begging when she says Minasan Konnichiwa! Kimagai Mona desu, is "mona desu" an informal way to introduce yourself? Yesu😂🤣 Oh, I didn't know that about tattoos, no wonder some people don't like them. instead of omoiyari I always heard about 気を使うwhen I was in Tokyo but they are a little different. 良いが勉強できた。 3:43 girl with face mask predicted Covid 19.

沖縄ではないかな。 easy Japanese ?are you sure? Perfect.A bit old to comment, but why don't you folks monetize this with ads? I would gladly sit down to watch an ad for this Arigato Sensei Omg such a sweet and amazing teacher thanks ME: *dieing on the inside because this is a free freaking corse* 0:57 is しごと just work and 会社 office? great having rhe Japanese with the pics, but it would still be useful to have the English translation at least to start THANK YOUUUU! Duo-lingo could never.
I didn’t realize how much duo lingo wasn’t teaching me.
Most stuff on duolingo isn’t explained or is too formal
But this lady is a great teacher and I love listening to her sweet voice.
And I love how kind she is, if only I had a teacher this nice. 😢💗💗💗💗
Bless her for making these lessons. Thankyou for teaching us. きょうはほんとにありがとうございます 11 years ago this video was posted, I'm watching this in 2021 XDDD

I cannot be asked to watch Japanese pod101, they have 1+ hour long videos and I cannot be asked, also can someone help me with the meaning of.

Ikimasu
Ikimasen
Ikimashita
Ikimasen deshita
iie, ikimasen deshito The Subtitles I am asking Is this Korean or Japanese? my first time actually learning to say a sentence in a foreign laguage, thank you, i mean arigato gozaimasu :D Arigato gozaimasu I wish I could give you money because I feel bad because I’m not giving you money in your helping me learn Japanese I feel really happy watching this for free and I am nana  years old Learning Japanese I don’t like watching is free It was unclear on what the sentences mean I need lessons on how to do sentence structure. should you add a question mark at the end of the question on any japanese sentence?? arigato gozaimasuu (I took notes >w< pls correct me if there's a mistake:)

Going to a Destination:

to go = *ikimasu* (future tense) 
 	     *ikimasen* (negative tense) + _not_

             *ikimashita* (past) 
 	     *ikimasen deshita* (past negative)

*> Places*

Department Store - *Depāto*
Work = *Shigoto*
Party = *Pati*
Station = *Eki*

*> FORMULA*

Place + ni + iki(-masu) / (-masen) / (-mashita) / (-masen deshita)
(‘ni’ is a particle for phrases)

ex.

*depato ni ikimasu.*
_I will go to the department store._

*eki ni ikimasen.*
_I will not go to the station._

…….

*> Time*

Today = *Kyou*
Yesterday = *Kino*
Tomorrow = *Ashita*
Day after tomorrow = *asatte* [asa-te]
Day before yesterday = *ototoi*

*Ashita depāto ni ikimasu.*
_I will go to the department store tomorrow._

*Asatte eki ni ikimasen.*
_I will not go to the station the day after tomorrow._

*Kinō eki ni ikimashita.*
_I went to the station yesterday._

*Ashita shigoto ni ikimasu.*
_I will go to work tomorrow._

*Ashita Japan Society ni ikimasu.*
_I will go to Japan Society tomorrow._

……..

*> Question & Answer*

? = *ka*
yes = *hai*
no = *ie*

To create a question sentence in Japanese, use the word "Ka" at the end of the sentence:

 *ka* = ?

————————————————
ex.

*Pāti ni ikimasu ka?*
_Will you go to the party?_

Answer:

*Hai, ikimasu.*
Yes, I will go.

or

*Iie, ikimasen.*
No, I won’t be there.

————————————————

*Ototoi depāto ni ikimashita ka?*
_Did you go to the department store the day before yesterday?_

Answer:

*Hai, ikimashita.*
Yes. 

or

*Iie, ikimasen deshita.*
No.

————————————————

*Kinō pāti ni ikimashita ka?*
_Did you go too the party yesterday?_

Answer:

*Hai, ikimashita.*
Yes. 

or

*Iie, ikimasen deshita.*
No. So to say "I am going to the station" is it "Watashi wa eki he? ni? ikimasu" is it he or ni? That was fun 🥰 I understand this so quick, because she teach too clean and calm. 素晴らしいレッスンをありがとう And arigato Idk why but I never understand I’ve been pretty good in lesson 1&2 Arigato gozaimas mam😀 4:09 me:kyo??? :>>>> Am i the only onewriting this down?

Legend😂❤ Mam, you just saved Japan and Anime to me. I am coming !! I'm watching this at 2020 O_o People who dislike this video they think they good enough 🇯🇵❤️😍👋👋👋👋👋 Arigatō sensei, watashinonamaeha Hamidodesu, watashi wa anata no ressun o aishiteimasu, watashi wa hontōni rikai shite imasu Why I can't play the videos? :( Konnichiwa I want to thank this people!they are helping us to learn Japanese ❤️❤️❤️❤️ ma'am thank you so much, i would like to saw ads at this vid. but they weren't. thank you ma'am ! you're such a kind person Where is she teaching now? She's really a good Sensei HOLY GOD THE AUTO GENERATED CAPTIONS IN ENGLISH OF THIS ARE FREAKY いいえいきません Lesson 4 completed! 😊👍 Arigato gozaimasu sensei. It’s 2020 now and I’m starting to learn japanese cooooozzzz I’m going there 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 I dont understand when do u put ka after the sentence  T^T I would love to go to evening classes but since the pandemic I'm not sure where there would be any, for now I'm using you tube tutorials and Duolingo but I think overall language skills would improve greatly with the social aspect, particularly the speaking side of it, learning from a tutor and practicing exercises with class mates but having to wear masks when you need to practice the vocalisation would just be nuisance, you also need to be able to hear clearly what they are saying as well, masks just muffle your voice!!https://goo.gl/ths9c5 Click here to learn Japanese twice as fast with FREE PDFs! I only want to learn japanese just to watch anime without sub or dub せんせい, ありがと ございます You're cute :) I would watch more of this but there are 2 problems: 1/ I was hoping to see the phrases in Japanese text instead of Kanji.  2/ You are too cute :-) I was waiting for her to use the words in a a Japanese sentence but she is teaching us English instead 😅 y'all say itadakimasu before drinking water... really?

 **Weebs**: “Waifu iru!" I play this on 0.75 speed.  It helps me, because I’ve always wanted to learn from Risa but she is a quick speaker.  Easier to pick up each piece without stumbling Are the casual “yes/no” spelled うん/うぅん？ Why is your people killing dolphins in Taiji? Its distressing!!!!!!!!!

I get super nervous and brain freeze trying to speak Japanese. So I end up only saying simple easy words phrase/words like, Hello, Goodbye, Thank you, Excuse Me.

I am a 76 year old retired trucker (driver of large trucks.)  I live in North Carolina. 
If you would say the Japanese words several times and one time very slowly that would be good.
I’ve seen a lot of YouTube videos of Japanese people.  The ladies and girls in Japan are so sweet and cute!!  
We have a word in English . . . . “Personality.”  It means the way you speak and move and laugh.  Just all the little things that make you Risa. 
I pray that all the men of Japan appreciate you ladies and treat you very well and protect you always.  
The God of the British and American Bible has great plans for you including an eternal future as His daughters. :) made me laugh and learn a bunch! Youre very funny !! Arigato ! 5:06 ok I'm actually laughing my face off ありがとうございます Shes so cute I know most of the phrases lol.

👌👁👄👁 Big fan of Japanese anime. Especially your name anime.❤️❤️❤️ I found out that Chinese, korean and japanese are all inter-connected.

In order to learn japanese or Korean, we need a Little knowledge of Chinese language 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 18:07 btw its just a mark for where im at ima leave the rest for tomorrow ありがとう！ I thank *babascove._* on Instagram who is a spellcaster. My family have been scattered and separated but when I encountered him, I gave him some informations he requested for and after that, everything worked out very fast and unbelievable. my husband called me, and we settled and by family is back. My children, my husband and me are together now. I'm really happy for the good work of babascove. I recommend him for his good works *laughs in japanese Lol I just want to be that cool guy who speak another language me knowing hiragana 😎 Ty for teaching me Y’all are all “I’m here because of anime” and I’m hear because I’m going to foreign exchange Ik how to say thank you In Japanese Why learn a new language?
Me: well I don’t like sharing the couch when I get time to watch tv, so I am gonna learn Japanese because then I can watch anime in Japanese and my siblings have no reason to sit next to me since they can’t understand. I know it petty. なぜ母国語を学ぼうとしているのですか？ Arigatou gozaimasu mam my parents: wants me to learn arabic 

me: learns japanese and korean instead It's 29. Minutes and 48 seconds Yep >:D aot no subtitles here I come Me: needs to learn Russian because I'm russian
Also me: Well it would be nice to watch anime without subtitles... Good thing you don’t have the collar for this like Spencer did in ICarly IGo to Japan and the pain feeling in the throat when you are learning to speak Japanese!!! Despite being about Japanese, this 30 min video taught me more about the English language than any English class I have ever taken. I only hate captions. Just cannot hold anymore I’m just here so I can watch anime’s without the subtitles. And to confuse my family. 😂 The japanese hosts name is really Risa? Really or did some editor dick not learn ls and rs are pronounced similar in Japanese I'm here so I can understand anime without subtitles 6:15 the japanese use chicken as their writing system😭😂 I learn a lot what about gomenasai? should it be avoided? like the domo instead of arigatou? Putting the object before the verb feels oh so wrong. Stamp mark for me 13:49 Me who already knows what arigato means because of anime 13:17 also, thank you. i was rlly confused when I’d heard them say English words but the translation say the English word at the end. i wish there was only one language 
but then there wouldn’t be Greek or Japanese.
they both are so beautiful I’m so glad i exist in a world with them both. i want to learn japanese becuse i wanna sound like a anime Wow will i actually be able to understand japanease animes without sub POG This was helpful because I recently moved to japan for work Arigatou nya iche ni san 
Thankyou nya 1 2 3 :me types how to speak japenese 
:all videos sasageyo sasageyo putashi sageyoooooooo
Bloweds minddddd アップルが食べた Gonna make this bih ma 3rd language on godnem Dekuuuuuu My goal is to watch mha without subtitles XD Me already knowing a little from anime subbed: I understand you yessss the power hak Actually we're all here because of anime 👀🍵 それいいね👍😊 I do watch anime, but the only reason I want to learn Japanese is because I like the the way it sounds, and the flow of it. My friend teaches me Japanese in a game called roblox ¥£€¥ what's the point of learning a language if u aren't gonna use it in real life weebs ∩^ω^∩ heheh Alisha doesn't really speak japanese. Alisha says she can speak fluent japanese but in all the videos of her talking about japanese all she ever said was konnichiwa. What gives Alisha? CAN  YOU SPEAK JAPANEZE OR NOT? main benefit: pissing off  your friends because they only speak english Hehe I know how to pronounce them cause I already speak another language, although I would like to know how to start a conversation, that’s why I’m here, to learn how to speak, well, that’s obvious. alright boiz time to turn subtitles off Risa: *why learn a new language* 


Me: *because it’s fun* Arigatou for teaching me how to speak Japanese What's the next video in this series? yay now I can say killer queen bites the dust while throwing a grenade at someone OMG!  Finally ! that makes sense now.  I just started and got a bit lost right away in trying to figure out how to make sense of it all. Everything suddenly seemed daunting. I should have started with this video and then with the LEARN HIRAGANA lessons.  Thanks for the video. That little bit of grammar info just blew my mind. It all makes sense now. I think im gonna not move ahead. I think im going to take this lesson and start over ! redo everything already done.  I bet its going to be much more fun this time. Wish me luck. 
Again, Thank you for the video's and making them available online. 
Alexander. Now time to go learn Russian! :A lot of the expressions used in anime are not used in daily conversion.
Me: “well, there goes that idea” PepeLaff 2020 olympics Everybody: "Yeah lets learn Japanese, that could be useful.."
Me: "I WANT TO GO ON A DATE WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL HOST" AAA THANK YOU THIS IS AMAZING AAA
I LEARNED SO MUCH THANK YOUUU!!

なるほど.... どうもありがとうございます! Awesome Very fast nt understaqo slow screen qoing fast make it again Sayonara got me 729! So many comments about learning Japanese only for anime without subtitles lol. That is a lot of effort for something so small. Taking on learning the Japanese language is a huge task requiring tons of dedication. Anyone actually commit to this? I've been studying Japanese on and off for many years now for much more than Anime and I still find it hard to understand 100% everything in an Anime. I got Japanese books, audio clips (such as this), I talk to a few Japanese friends, play through a few Japanese games, and tag everything in my house with the Japanese word corresponding to it, and more. If anyone here in the comments actually learned Japanese for anime, was it worth it? lol  :P 30:30 (for me to remember) i watch everything with subtitles, ENG and JP alike. I need this for my degree lmao.
僕は、頑張って！！！
12:40 the issue with this is its to much for 1 video and its not real voices its electronic voices trying to sound natural It helps a lot for foreigners planning to go to Japan. I love the annoyed, mad, get lost phrases (❁´◡`❁) So shiyou - Let's do it/that
Nazena no - Why not

I ain't Japanese, was just confused about this one and consulted google translate for anyone who's interested. 2:11 my brother name is tom lol 8:18 isn't it nan demo nai any tips how to study kanji easier? I am bad at reading them... Wait , may i ask if wht is “watashi wa Byōkides” ? is it the same as 'im sick' ? 12:24 ところどころ辛辣なのマジで草 Me tries to study japanese:
My brain:




Watashi wa yame ta 質問あれば答えます from japanese Arigatou gozaimasu おめでとございます！！！ ありがとう EVERYONE: im learning this so i can watch anime with out subtitles
Me: i wanna go to Japan, and this is ammunition to fire at my parents.. " WHY CANT WE GO TO JAPAN, I KNOW HOW TO SPEAK JAPANESE!!!!!" 😂 Damare 1100 bro... ☠️ reason why learning japanese : can understand anime without subtitles

Okane ya nai n da im learning So are you here to write like sonic? brain malfunctioned, im japanese but i dont know some of these words i- The words in the beginning of this video remind me so much of Anime! *some of people’s reasons why they learn japanese is to watch anime without subtitles, and i also have the same reason but i saw this girl from social media and she is super good at japanese she started learning at 11 and someone asked her if she watch anime without sub and she replied “i tried watching without sub, but its still hard because they talk so fast but i understand most of them.” and make me think should i still learn japanese? because thats my reason watching anime without sub. but i said to my self i’ll still keep going because i could also use it when i got to japan if its not covid or whatever. (the girl im talking about was a weeb 😔💅🏻)* "くたばれ" very useful, will use everyday. The only sentence I know in japanese is: omae wa mou shindeiru. Nani!?!?! Yoku yatta My reason to watch this is for school and anime purposes.. The reason why I wanna learn japanese is because I wanna understand those asmr japanese anime boys that I've been listening to.😂 Watashi wa yame ta... ネイティブの言い回しがわかるから英語の勉強にも便利 please give some time to write on the note book .very very less time to write

konichiwa 9:33 Arigato kozaimasu for teaching me japanese 😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍😘👍😍 ар So, have you thought about where you're spending the rest of eternity? I'm sure you know heaven/hell are ideas, but what if I told you They're real? In fact they are. You see humans are like potted plants. Ever since the he fall we've becomes the ones that choose witch seeds get planted. We justify little sins, because we can rationalize them. But those sins seep in our souls like tea. It slowly taints our essence, until we're justifying worse and worse sins. Those sin seeds grow into weeds that blind us to the Truth. We see others doing worse, so we rationalize that we're still good people. But those seeds always bloom into evil we cannot control. Then we become monsters. Most people don't want to be evil, so we prune ourselves. However, once we die we continue to grow. This is why Hell exists. God cannot allow bad plants into Heaven, we'd destroy it. That's why he gives us this life on Earth, to better our relationship with him, so that he can kill those wicked weeds. This only happens with the blood of Jesus Christ, and can only be gotten though our own free will. You need to forgive your parents, we all have problems with them, don't lie. It's a representation of or problems with God. To be forgiven we must forgive. Everyone, but your parents especially. After that, brake down before Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and read the Bible. God will enlighten you to so much after that. It will literally be like seeing for the first time. There's so much going on beneath the surface layer of reality, but you can't be taught, only learn. Reading the Bible will actually be fun at this stage, I know that sounds impossible, but it is true. God has given us so much truth, so many promises, you'll delight in learning them. Plus he'll shower you in great blessings. True joy, inner peace, love, fulfillment, etc. It all lies in service to the Lord. There truly is no greater happiness. I hope you get the message. Don't say I never tried. Bless you buddy I'm thinking of going to osaka このビデオは好きです🙃btw I've been learming Japanese for like 3-4 months now and I'm wondering how easy this now has become for me unlike when I newly started learning japanese;) me trying to learn japanese and sleep : I love Asmr

Then she brought in the kanji ... Could you perhaps make an intermediate guide? I’d love to know more about grammar, and perhaps learn some kanji! ♥️🌹🌹🌹♥️💋💋💋 A good way to learn kanji pronounciation is to play Japanese kids games. Like games for Nintende 3DS for example. A lot of them have kanji with furigana :D Why em I do happy I can read a little bit of japanese 😁😁 Konichiwa can also be said as good afternoon in a way.
こんにちはは、昼の挨拶も使われているよ。Hi friends! I know this is an old video but I just wanted to say THANK YOU for the all the love and support that this video is getting. 🤗 I’ve been getting a lot of corrections on this video including the “こんにちわ” and my pronunciation and I appreciate all of it. I’d like to think I’ve gotten a little better now as I’m doing my best to constantly improve. ☺️

Me : Time to Study Japanese! Reasons to learn Japanese:
Anime
Travelling to Japan 
Insult my friens without them realising.
Impress my friends. Intro music sensei???? My reason for learning Japanese is because 10 years ago, I had a childhood friend who was a Japanese. We used to hangout a lot, until she returned back to Japan. Though she spoke perfect english, I still wish to communicate with her in Japanese. It's been 2 years since I've started learning, and I still haven't told her yet. We've kept in touch through out the years, and I'm travelling to Japan hopefully next year to meet her. I'm still at N2 level, but I hope to reach N1 before this year ends Mori saaaaan 😍 I reallyyyyy want to learn Japanese but alwyas lose the motivation for it ugh Thank you that was really helpfulllll! Im studying Japanese starting with hiragana. Till now its good im practicing the basics. But im worried if i wont be able to memorize all the rules for hiragana/ katakana/ kanji. And how u pronounce them correctly so u can sound fluent. Thank U So Much What kind of journal do you use? ни Mom: why don't you be a doctor?
Me: but I want to be a translator :( I am watching the anime on 8:12 this video motivated me a lot! thank you for the inspiration and advice. I'm studying japanese too Naol may tsikolit haha Anime brought me here.What abt u?😍 Thank you for this. 🥺 You are right, it’s a sign to continue studying Japanese. You’re video made me realize how and why I really wanted to pursue it. 🎀 🌸 Veo estos vídeos para saber como estudiar japonés mientras aprendo un poco de Inglés KLGKS but can i learn This as a 12 year old how long would this take me😭😃 reasons i wanna learn japanese:
• understand media obv
• hashtag bragging rights
• other languages i wanna learn when i grow up so japanese is my foundation
• i just really love the country and cukture in general ww hi po! aaa i love the video editing so much
do you ever feel unmotivated to learn? how do you overcome this or do you just stop for the while? on off kasi ako for the past 3 years i havent gone far at all 😭 -probably also the fact i was 10 when i first started tho lol- I've a question
How much can I earn in a year if I'm a fast learner? you inspired me Mori! Thankyou so much for the tips!!
Arigato SENSEI❤️ Hi everyone! I am a Japanese American teenager (native speaker in Japanese) and I just made a discord server for Japanese learners to interact and help each other out. I am willing to help anyone who needs help & doing 1v1 session for FREE. 
CODE : JDqM66Ndbz Thank you so much for help me to study Japanese☺ I don't know how to make a schedule :((( I sell objects on the cover of the video that I know where they sell in Brazill 🐢(store name is Daiso)
Daiso sells various things from Japan, which is my favorite store hihi.I loved your lyrics, my Japanese Japanese lyrics are terrible. I learned something really important from you, I want to study japanese but in only 13 but need to focus on school😭😭 please tell me what is the last movie name? with little boy and fish Hello Mori! This was my first time on your channel. I really liked the video and your tips to learn the language. I wanted to know about what kind of keyboard you use to type the scripts? The one I used once missed out on a lot of the symbols (like quotation and question marks, period symbol etc.), kanji script and a few other things. It would be lovely if you recommend a good one. Arigatou! :) the one thing thats always stuck with me, bc my classments had to say this everytime to go to the toilet, "　トイレに行ってもいいですか。” i mean it made us speak in japanese but the amount of times people who got tripped up over having to say this was hilarious XD my reason for learning japanese is:
confusing my family/friends
my current dream is to move there and become a translator or english teacher
watching anime with subs
bragging 私わあなたの声が大好きです、それわ可愛です✨️ あなたのビデオを作ってくれてありがとう! why i am studying japanese:
a) i am japanese
b) i plan to move to japan with my best friend once we graduate from college! she is also studying japanese and motivates me a lot :)
c) i hope to be able to speak more fluently with my mum and grandparents! reasons why i wanna learn japanese
-Anime(so i dont have to read the subtitles sometimes)
-I have cousins and aunts who are japanese(were close families so ye we vc alot my aunt is Filipino but married a japanese :))
-I wanna go to japan it would be easier if i know japanese when i go there her life is like my pinterest home page ありがとうござます that's all I can say for now but I will surely practice harder and your video was amazing. So I'm already following 3 of the 8 steps:
5) Watch anime
6) Listen Japanese songs
7) Inspiration - watch anime without subtitles がんばれー！応援しちょるよ Me: creates a schedule.
Also me: where tf is my calendar at. some told me to not memorise kanji or learn them by itself tho. Hiiii Mori your videos are very cute and makes me to study Japanese 
Lot's of love from India 🇮🇳❤️ OMG RADWIMPS! yay 🌸🌸🌸🌸 This is very encouraging, gotta push more my japanese Should i start learning  Hiragana first or  Katakana? I would like to know if there is a similar app to crunchy Nihongo because my phone is not compatible with the apps. I would appreciate it if you can share.ありがとうございます、森さん！ Crunchy Nihongo don’t work for me :( Interesting 🥰 6/10 advice, there were stuff that I disagreed with, but overall it’s okay advice. Excellent video. It Has all 😊💜 10:15 I want it. So cute! I need it Thank you so much Mori san i got inspired by ❤️✨ Those are the cutest penguin pajamas I've ever seen. Her japanese voice is like the anime girls' cute voice OMLLL Where did you buy your books mori? Im planning to buy a books. watching this really motivated me! i really want to learn nihongo since i watch a lot of vtuber contents and i want to watch live streams without struggling. i also stan some japanese boygroups and they don't really put eng cc to their contents. being an intl fan is really hard 😩 My reasons for learning Japanese: 

*Want to watch anime without subtitles/read manga that hasnt been translated to English
*Maybe move to Japan or get a job there even if it is for a little bit or just a visit
*I love Japan's culture at least what I have learned so far of it, it seems so beautiful and the people are very polite
*Bragging rights on both of my older brothers (both have attempted to learn Japanes but failed) 
*On the topic of my brothers, maybe teach them a little someday since they still want to learn but are just unmotivated
*Better chance for college
*I started to love the process of learning a language when I first moved to the USA and learned English from my home country of Chile and now I want to learn another language, specifically japanese
*Finally, to confuse my family even more since my parents and my grandparents (they occasionally visit once or twice every two years if we dont go to Chile during the Summer) only speak or mostly speak Spanish (≧∇≦)b Heh... Doulingo taught me words i taught i wouldnt know for the rest of my life but finally... I have found the dictionary that contains all the words ive been learning... 10:21 凄い！  😭✨ a big fan of that series, been watching for hundred times. 167+4+ yashahime ❤ From which country r u?? HER: HAS A REASON TO LEARN
ME: FLEX:] What is Japan like? 😎 Already listen to Japanese songs, favorites: RPG, Magical Doctor, Suck it up & Aishite i love watching anime and i always listening to the anime song, writting problem because my writting level is already legendary its look like a zigzag spagetty hahaha, i think its still hard for me but im going to try always because im still kiddo 15 years old, learn,write,read... arigatou this vid is helful for a kid like me :) I wanna learn Japanese because me and my friends are planning to live there and study there together Me: I will remember this. 
My brain: あいうえお She is a Japanese girl , who learns  Japanese through apps , and we BAKA S. Are watching this Me who can understand but cant speak, write, or read it.
“The fact that i can understand them but they cant understand me is what i found funny about it” arigatho I love the intro music ☺️
Btw this was very helpful thank you 💜 Umm the main reason why i want to learn Japanese in such a young is because ahh you could say that i'm getting ready for the future ,, Make Anime* 😅 seems like we are going to start nursery rhymes 
But I still like that hi i really like your video, may I ask what "on" and "kun" means at 7:09? Im a beginner, so I kinda got confused T T 7:11 Why do you mark some of the kanji's kun-reading parts in red marker? Does it imply intonation or something? :0 Do u have alphabets like a abcdefg like in the English language 

Cause well I was very confused about the word I

Meaning watashi when u say it in Japanese but very different in hiragana Arigato gozaimasu sensei Kon ni chi wa Mori yeah I am also studying and learning Japanese I just started a month ago My reason to start learning japanese :
1. I want to go to college in Japan to be better at making art cause I want to be an illustrator
2. I want to work there if possible

Reasons why I haven't started : 
1. I am currently still learning English and my teacher said it's better if I also start learning mandarin because many companies in my country (Indonesia 🇮🇩) are owned by chinese-indonesian people so it will be easier to get a job which is related to art
2. I am and will be very busy with school and I have to get high scores as per usual with homework everyday + art practice +workout + house chores, so I don't know if I can manage my time (f my country's education system) .
3. There're just too many things I have to do at the same time
4. I am inconsistent
🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ (I'm 15 btw) 

So can anyone give me advice on how to manage my time? I am very desperate 😩 I find it to be easier if you just do this
1: Understand the kanji, how to structure sentences using hiragana and katakana
2: Understand what the kanji means and what (if) the kanji represents an object and what it means
3: Practice every day ❤わたしは、あなたを愛しています I want to learn Japanese, but my Chinese grades will definitely go down... why i learn japanese:
- easiest foriegn language(my native language(korean) is very similar to japanese)
- i luv its pronouncation
- im language lover
- it can be helpful since im a conlanger
- beautiful writing system(hiragana&katakana)

btw am i only learner who don't really watch anime? lol You can study  my language , i am srilanaka 🇱🇰,.,, i challenge you, my language shinhala 👋👋👋💞🇱🇰🇱🇰 BUT DONT TRY LEARNING FROM ANIME !!! watch youtube videos about fluent japanese speakers. you won't get anything from scripited lines Why i wanna learn japanese:
the languge is cool
i wanna live in japan in the future
anime lol I just began learning today through Duolingo, I want to be able to hang out with my Japanese friend online without using Google translate, and i want to be able to communicate a little bit easier when I visit japan when I'm older! 
I'm still very young so I struggle, but I suppose if you start early you will have a much easier time when you're older. You handwriting is so good- Thanks for the extra food😭 */pretends to eat while crying23:54 Didn't she just say you can't use で with imasu? how come when i translate things like "to walk" "to cross" it wont show what the video shows? I love how they also teach you other things like confusing pronunciation and go over different verbs that are commonly said with the particle instead of JUST telling you what the particle does. very helpful thank youu<33 This Ken fella they keep talking about seems like a really worldly dude. Good for him. I tried to write a Japanese sentence on a HiNative live, but the person couldn't understand me because I wasn't using the particles, oof. It made me feel ashamed that I embarrassed myself in front of multiple people, but that's the price you have to pay when learning new things, right?

I think I can slightly understand the topic of Japanese particles, but when I try to make a sentence, all the knowledge just gets yeeted out of my brain. I'm still going to keep on pushing, and to anyone who is confused like me, we will push through this together to reach fluency. Good luck to you all. I am the 28000th liker of the video! 🙂 0:49 は
topic marking particle and contrast marking particle

5:34 が
(Subject particle) indicates existence and marks an object of desire 

10:08 を
(Object particle/ marker ) indicates the place of movement and comes after a direct object of an action 

15:18 へ
Direction particle and marks a recipient of an action 
(Usually indicates a direction or a goal)

18:27 に
Location or time particle (it also indicates existence) What about the particle "ya"? just confused

I go to school by bus
watashi ha basude gakkouni ikimashita.

In my understanding it supposed to be 

Watashi ha basude gakkou e ikimashita. 7:50 (placeholder) in 20:06, can i use "ga" before imasu? its really hard bc im used to put ga before imasu and arimasu So that’s why when i’m watching Japanese comedy show, i struggle to hear sentences, because of dialects and different spelling, also the particle sometimes just erased from sentences. Just started briefly learning the language. Can someone tell me why there's "desu" or what it signifies in the two sentences at 5:12? Thanks! Even when it's explained thoroughly I still don't understand
I guess I'm just dumb :P Being a Tamilian or some other language with similar sentence pattern as japanese is easier! Only thing difficult hear is English!😁 No to mono. There is a font This video is almost 50 mins long but it took me 2 hours to finish the video Bruh 私のコンピューターでヘンタイお見るです
is this correct? Ngl this is ten times harder than Physics Sorry. I’m still confused. Great  and helpfully thank you Question: could you also say "te de sushi o tabemasu" ? Or is it wrong? Alisha and Risa you both are very beautiful.  愛してる　Alisa 　 i feel motivated when i see your videos.🥰Only watch those videos for you😍 12:40 I must say ,. Translating to English really doesn't help in explaining the usage . I'm Indian ,Tamilian to be precise, translating to Tamil helps far better than in English. the last exemple in the particale "de" : sushi o te de tabemasu ; shouldn't it be : te de sushi o tabemasu  ??? Love your video 😍  just finding about particles I'd studied Japanese Language in the Japanese Cultural Center and the Japanese Association. My level was up to intermediate. It was more than ten years ago and it is so refreshing and easy going through this lesson. I have almost forgotten how to write but when it comes to reading, it is much easier. I like this tutorial. It is not too fast and the explanation is very clear. Thank you for this free lesson and hopefully I will remember and at least converse simple Japanese with my Japanese friend. Another challenging moments within history of human's tool of communication... ganbarimasu! that last one destroyed me... Thanks rizza! hmm, so "kara" and "made" are closely related. can it mean "from _ to _"? (like the last example when talking from children to even adults) After learning hiragana and katakana, i think this jinkan should be prioritized because it will give sense to everything. Unlike memorizing sets of words each day not knowing how to.  This of course only applies to complete beginner like me. 

So if you are a beginner. Learn Hiragana Katakana then Particles. Then proceed to making japanese rap songs! Watch a video they said, it’ll help they said
now, i hate grammar more than i could of ever with the addition to japanese gramer Please, I’m so confused 😭 all I know is の 4:46 Thank you very very much! This is so helpful!!!! I'M AT 12:09. GONNA SLEEP SEE YOU TOMORROW 39:26 I don't believe that Takashi is Canadian, I think he is Japanese. 17:43 VERY GOOD!!! wa for me its easier to remember as concerning. Concerning tommorow its saturday watashi wa megumi ( concerning me im grace) if that makes sense sorry for the romaji im too lazy to pull out the japanese keyboard Is there any lesson with only Risa and her acting that teach tenses ? を。。。i am o
 Meanwhile お left the job... Gah! My head hurts... My brain doesn't want to learn this. Like, it's eating every information in each lesson during the video but when it ends, it'll just throw it all up. I can't remember a thing. T^T I love this, great work Ken is so smart 😭 5000 kanji 😱 Brain is in pain 😭 Me who knows all of them: Thanks! I met alisha when I lernt english. Now i learn nihonggo and I meet her again. Cant really understand if hashi is a chopstick or a bridge please help 977ꀘ ꒦ꀤꏂꅐꌚ Here are my notes. . . it's a lot. . .

は Particle
Comes after the topic of the sentence. 
Example: 明日は土曜日です。Translated: Tomorrow is Saturday.
To show contrast, we can use は twice in a sentence. 
Example: 魚は食べます。でも、肉は食べません。Translated: I eat fish, but I do not eat meat.
Example 2: 犬は好きです。でも、猫は嫌いです。Translated: I like dogs, but I do not like cats.
This use of the particle は results in more contrast between the two things.

を Particle
Comes after the object of the sentence.
Example: 私は肉を食べます。Translated: I eat meat. 
Example 2: 私はカレーを作りました。Translated: I made curry.
Example 3: これをください。Translated: Please give me this one.

The を particle is also used to indicate the place of movement. 
Example: 公園を歩きます。Translated: To walk through a park.
Example 2: 橋を渡ります。Translated: To cross the bridge.
Example: 亀は海を泳ぎます。Translated: Turtles swim in the sea. 

が Particle
Comes after subject but can also mark the object in certain scenarios.

Example 3: 宿題があります。Translated: There is homework. (Means: I do not have homework.)

We can attach 欲しいです at the end of a sentence to indicate desire to have the object. 
Example: 私は時間が欲しいです。Translated: I want time. 
Example 2: 私はピンクの車が欲しいです。Translated: I want a pink car. 

By attaching たい at the root of a verb (taking away ま and replacing it with たいです) we can show a want to do something.
Example: 私はお茶が飲みたいです。Translated: I want to drink tea. 
Example 2: 私は肉が食べたいです。Translated: I want to eat meat. 

へ Particle
It is pronounced え, and it usually indicates a direction or goal. 
Example: メキシコへ行きます。Translated: To go to Mexico. 
Example 2: 空港へ行きます。Translated: Go to the airport. 
Example 3: これは空港へ行きますか。Translated: Does this go to the airport. 
Example 4: 私は家へ帰ります。Translated: I am going home.

The へ particle can also mark a recipient in a sentence. 
Example: 友達へ電話をかけました。Translated: I called my friend. 
Example 2: 父へメールをしました。Translated: I emailed my father. 

に Particle
This particle serves to mark locations. This particle is often used in sentence that end with either います or あります.
Example: 駅に兄がいます。Translated: My brother is at the station.
Example 2: 兄はチェコに住みます。Translated: My brother lives in the Czech Republic. 
Example 3: 父はお店にいます。Translated: My father is at the store. 

The に particle can also be translated at “in” “on” and “at”
It indicates a point in time when something takes place. 
Example: 七時に起きます。Translated: I wake up at 7 o’clock.   
Example 2: 月曜日に帰ります。Translated: I will be back on Monday. 
Example 3: 六月に日本へ行きます。Translated: I am going to Japan in June.
Example 4: 土曜日に駅へ帰ります。Translated: I will return to the station on Saturday. 

The に particle CANNOT follow relative time expressions. Like today, tomorrow, or next year.

で Particle 
This particle marks locations, means of doing something, materials something is made from, or a reason for something. 

Location marking:
The particle で marks where an action takes place.
Example: 駅で会いましょう。Let’s meet at the station. 
Example 2: 学校で日本語を勉強しています。I study Japanese at my school.
Example 3: 家で寿司を食べます。I eat sushi at my house. 

Means of transportation:

Example 2: 私の家です。It is my house.
Example 3: これは私のです。This is mine.
Example 4: これはケンさんの鞄ですか。Is this Ken’s bag?

Using の to show attributes of a certain object:
Example: 英語の先生 English teacher 
Example 2: 桜の花 Flower of cherry (Cherry blossom)
Example 3: 私の友達の名前はカイです。My friend’s name is Kai.
Example 4: 日本の車が好きです。I like Japanese cars.

Example 3: ハンバーガーと天ぷらとコーラをください。Can I please have a hamburger, tempura, and a coke?
Example 4: 肉と魚が好きです。I like meat and fish.

Using と to say “together” or “with”
Example: 兄と姉は寿司を食べます。My brother and sister eat sushi.
Example 2: 父と英語の先生は話です。My father and my English teacher are talking.

か Particle
The か particle is a question particle because adding it to the end of a sentence will make it a question. 
Example: パパはアメリカ人です。My dad is an American. VS パパはアメリカ人ですか。Is my dad an American?
Example: 何月ですか。What month is it?

Informal sentences:
In informal Japanese, か is replaced with の.
Example: クミは英語がわかる. Kumi understands English. VS クミは英語がわかるの？Does Kumi understand English? 


Using か to indicate choices.
か can sometimes mean “or”
Example: お茶かコーヒが飲みたいです。I want to drink tea or coffee. 
Example 2: バスか車で駅に行きたいです。I want to go to the station by car or bus.  
Example 3: お茶かコーラかコーヒーがあります。There is tea, cola, or coffee. 

も Particle 
The も particle usually follows a noun and mean “too” or “also”
It can replace the particles は, が, and を. 
Example: 父はアメリカ人です。私もアメリカ人です。My father is an American. I am also an American. (We replaced は with も in the second sentence.)
Example 2: 私も Me too
Example 3: これは私のです。それも私のです。This is mine. That is also mine.

Using も to emphasize the amount or extent of something:

Example: エミさんは漢字を５０００字も知っています。Emi knows 5,000 kanji. 
(By using も, the speaker emphasizes the amount of kanji Emi knows.)
Example 2: ２００万円もかかります。It costs 2 million yen. 
(Again, using も instead of は or が emphasizes the amount of money it costs.)
Example 3: その本は十回も読みました。I read that book ten times. 

から Particle 
This particle tells us when or where something begins. It often means “from”
Example: 三時からミーティングがあります。There is a meeting at 3 o’clock. 
Example 2: ここから駅へ行きます。I will go to the station from here. 
Example 3: ベルリンから車で行きました。I went from Berlin by car. 

Using から to indicate materials:
から (unlike で) is only used to indicate material when the final product does not resemble the material. 
When the material is of obvious nature, use で.
When the material has went through somewhat complex process, use either から or で.

Example: 米からお酒を作ります。I make sake from rice. 

まで Particle
The まで particle shows when and/or where does an action end. 
It can be translated as “until”
Example: 明日まで待ちます。I will wait until tomorrow. 
Example 2: 駅まで帰ります。I will return to the station. 
Example 3: 八時まで読みます。I will read until 8 o’clock. 

The まで particle can also indicate limit, extend, or an unexpected object. 
Example: 魚が好きです。骨まで食べます。I like fish. I even eat the bones. I learn how to say I want to go to the bathroom😀😀😀😀 it is correct if i say 私は公園を行きたいです??
i want to go to park for vocab i recomend japanese smiles its really good so as puni puni japan Why was the eating sushi with my hands. Sushi hands eat instead of hands sushi eat like the wheat it made (it was made with wheat) sentence You guys are amazing 🤩 thank very much 😍😍😍 I'm definitely going to recommend this to all my friends. You never realise how necessary it is to know Japanese particles until you finally learn them and then start reading things. This was wonderful, I even learned functions i didn’t in my elementary class in community college I just finished writing it all Ha

- 46:00 hey I've seen that 君に/僕に etc. is often used but に is used for places/time, so could someone explain this to me? ARE THEY SUFFICIENT FOR N5 ? You used same sample sentence "even children have their own cell phones" once with "mo" and once with "made" particle. It would have been nice if you'd explained the difference.

Also, could you please explain why in the example "I go to school by bus" you use Basu de gakko "ni" ikimasu and not gakko "he"... when "ni" is a location particle for locations where something exists while "he" is the location particle for destinations and this clearly is destination? Great content! 
A YouTube title that delivers to the expedition. 
As I study other materials I rewatch it from time to time. Things either make more sense or this gives a nice review. 
Thank you! My brother is called josh, me mat ha same same same same ! Same ni kiwotsukero ! same same same same ! kiwotukero ! Shark! shaku shaku same ni atara ii yo ii yo ii yoi ! lalalala! its so hard to actually sound Japanese for me, cause I practice impressions and some words I want to pronounce in a Spanish accent idk magaritai = I want to turn,  Magari Aru = there is a bend,   Magari ne = bend, Magari ka = is it a bend, Magari To =with a bend, Magari de= at the bend ... etc subject particle wo wa ni no ne  and o ? like wa = as for, speaking of, pertaining to, etc... Ni place ?  No posession of a thing like it belongs to you?  Ne relating particle marking i want you to agree or asking if this is a joined feeling.  and O indicates movement or marks the object like the box O or the Plate O hoshii desu is used for wanting something like to own or in the room with you, i want a stuffed animal for a pillow, if you say you want to do something I'm assuming it will be followed by ta ii most of the time, EX: climb , I want to climb or swim, or sit. ta II mark where a verb was used tabe = eat ------ tabetai = i want to eat. ohh tabemasu = to eat ---- tabeAru = have eaten. 20:42 line~
超像賴的提示音 Yes imagine の possessions. Why does the syllable "SU" always sounds like just the S? When using latin characters why isn't the 'U' left out? This video took me way WAY longer than 49 minutes to watch. 0:00 - 5:30 は
5:30 - 10:00 が
10:10 - 14:10 を Great content and substance, would be awesome if the delivery and package were more natural and less corporate. Me as Spanish speaker watching an English video about learning japanese. Kill two birds with one stone. So I understand the meaning I guess but I don't know how to put them in sentences I will be confused or should I  first learn vocabularies?? mantap materinya sugoi Hold on, honest question. Isn't "want" a verb? Why is it being classified as an adjective? Is it because it is essentially describing the state of the subject as wanting something? time: 0:47 : WA.

Learning tip! if you get a five subject notebook system and translate your dictionary and break down your subjects to Kanji,  words and definitions, radicals, particles, and sounds you will learn 1 thing at least I promise. IM BACK WITH A QUESTION. IF I COPY MY ENGLISH DICTIONARY With japanese will it be okay to do so or should I learn in a different way to stay respectful and accurate? 32:46: "HAMBURGER PLEASE!" so backwards that's like = your hometowns from where? right? " Doko kara shusshin " is it rude to say it this way ? doko kara shusshin 2 minuets  a piece then it seems I hated the idea of Translating something from one language to another so as long as I can keep the momentum of only having to read my sentence backwards I will not fail! MAGOKORO!  PUT YOUR HEART IN IT! Eureka !!!!! Ashita doyobi wa desu ! HAHAHAHAHAHAH I MADE THE SENTENCE I WANTED TO !! OISHII!! SWEET VICTORY OF PERSISTANCE ! Japanese is only fun cause I don't have the pressure of a curriculum. I just get to be a Character shouting things for hours like practicing for a play. Chia!! (Sakura voice) no not the flowers. hehe Ashite = feet lol Ashi = leg lol , but Ashi ashite ashi = tomorrow tomorrow lol haha "Shikata ga nai" i tried to go around it hehe splat on my face. Yasashi-sa !  Ashite do yobi desu = saturday and saturday.Does it work though? I constantly come back to these vids just to bask in the cringe comments. Someone help I can’t Learn pls someone help ;-; The hardest part about this video is sleeping... Nani!? I woke up And start speaking Japanese. Then I realised That Im Japanese now i need subtitles when i sleep Hai Does this actually work? Who did the anime artwork in the thumbnail? It's so beautiful The annoying thing is is that there are so many ads!!!! I woke up to 'call the police' 8:07:56 0:28 'put this on while your sleeping'

*gets woken up by a Vegemite ad" Me who already knew a phrase: I am goddess Thanks for putting 5 minute ads every 5 minutes that play at 150% volume and have trumpet fanfare in them.  
I can surely fucking sleep to this.  Fuck off with that shit seriously. this doesnt work, thx Tip: Learn the phrases beforehand, then sleep with this, it’ll just engrave it in your memory more Sleep paralysis demon won’t know what hit em’ So i may be getting 5-6 hours of sleep so i hope it still works out I hate to be a downer, but this is not helping me learn Japanese OR sleep;  I have had several separate nightmares where mysterious voices speaking Japanese have been haunting me in various locations.  This is not restful, nor am I retaining any of the words. The demon under my bed: 𝗄𝗈𝗇𝗇𝗂𝖼𝗁𝗂𝗐𝖺 👹👹👹 I am so going to rip this video off  in OBS and make my own
 Beep them and their commercials
 You can't fall asleep when you have commercials (video ends)

me: aight let's go to sleep That time i got reincarnated as a Japanese people Wait does this actually work?    I’m so confused!!! 😭😩 personal timestamp(s) :

*been learning for 2 and a half weeks and I'm getting a lot better July 5* i woke up in the middel of the noght wondering why are the ads so damn intense who's the girl in thumbnail I'm trying this and it turns to 1 hour ads :) これは私がたくさん学んだことをたくさん助けてくれます。日本語の文字を覚えていても、新しいことを学ぶのは本当に楽しいです！ Ohayou! RAID SHADOW LEGENDS Probably gonna forget it all after wake up🤣 猫はニャーのようになります cat be like meow After watching:
me: よろこび わたしはあなかがすいています！ おなまえわ？ これはたかすぎる いくらですた？ Me who forgot to switch my mobile data to wifi. :( The hardest part is getting 8 hours of sleep without distractions or Ads Peaceful sleep listening to nice calming Japanese ☺️ RAID SHADOW LEGENDS DOWNLOAD FOR FREE AND PLAY TODAY 0:28 1:17 May i sit here if you need lol Yall I think I woke up in the hidden leaf village I played this before sleeping and the next thing I know I learned an indian song... So I used to listen to this. I’m a sleep walker and I told my mom, in fluent Japanese “let me sleep, I’m tired”. My mom just stared at me. Then asked me what that meant. I told her in English that I don’t know what it means. The only way she knew it wasn’t gibberish is my friend knows Japanese so she translated. Now I don’t know any so time to relearn. I am reading aloud scary stories in Japanese.
My Youtube channel name is "岡 勝秀の 怖い話の朗読".
I hope you enjoy it. So many confrontational phrases in this one, who are we pissing off so bad that we must call the police and beg for a doctor😂 Pov you forget how to speak English If I don't start talking like jojo by tomorrow morning I wanna refund! 00:28 These ads are not necessary Bruh in duolingo it said that day time was hiru. WHICH IS RIGHT. Guys i woke up as an Amine character I woke up speaking Japanese. Then I realized I am Japanese i woke up and tried to speak Japanese and i felt like i was in Naruto I wanna learn japanse. I know dead well I aint never going to learn it 🤣 I need more braincells I have some constructive criticism... I absolutely love these videos, but I don't think I'll fall asleep to this one because I don't want to subliminally let "anger", "jealously", and "I don't forgive you" into my subconscious as I sleep. For sleeping videos, I would only use neutral and positive phrases. That aside, thank you for uploading these very useful videos! myかちっsぺあきんgじゃっぱねせりghtのwぉぁらあら Imma learn japanese while sleeping 8 hours.
Ads: nope , thats not gonna work in 8 hours I actually listened an hour of it be4 turning it off nd going to sleep lmao😂 Click to skip to start 0:28 If it says konichiwa as in hello it does not know google translate is a troll I listen to these everytime I have a plane ride Bold of ya’ll to assume I sleep 8 hours 😌 if i do this enough maybe i fully forget english then i never have to talk to my parents agsin Ummm does this work? Leave teh answers in the comment 😂🤣😂🤦‍♀️ I cant believe this has ads...... I woke up like this Lol I'm gonna test this and I'll edit it tomorrow Tip no.1 SKIP every add till u are in the no add part ez B) 00:28 Please move all your accounts to Bitchute, Rumble or other services.  We need to DEMONETIZE YOUTUBE Me: sleeps for like a hour
Me: wakes up
Also me: chotto matte I'm here on business reminded me of 
Important businessue THERE ARE ADDS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE the wifi here is too slow! 
please calm down
its a medicine...
thats okay
(call the police) Does it actually work 8hours + ads and you can't skip because you're sleeping Wish I can sleep with my headsets on Guys I listened to this at night and now my whole bedroom is pixelated guys help To stop the ads, go all the way to the end of the video and let the last few seconds play then hit replay. When you are excited to learn while sleeping but when you get up you see nothing came in the brain😂 Why so many ads.  It kinda defeats the purpose of binaural beats and such. I'm listening this while doing my homework lol Bro....am I the only one listening to this in 2021- 🧍🏽‍♀️ This would be a lot nicer without constant advertising interruptions. Bold of you to assume that I sleep 8 hours... but hey I got a some book with “Death Note” written on it Fuck you and the ads Dude why is 80% of this just non japanese?!
I came here to learn "japanese words" you know like, animals and weekdays and numbers. Not american states. Ffs why do all these "learn japanese" suck? Istg if I don't wake up as a anime character I'll murder everyone Can someone tell me if this actually works <3 Instructions unclear I woke up as an policeman due the addsI have learnt Japanese of hiragana, now I want learn Japanese of Katakana...

Confusingggggg like ahhhh I just learned Hirigana and is about to learn katakana let's see my hands after this :DD シツンソノ
┻━┻ ヘ╰( •̀ε•́ ╰) Personally, I find this to be much harder to learn than hiragana. Mainly because of how similar a lot of the characters are. Why do they need to be so confusing! I always confuse シ ツ and ン ソ together. Beginner japanese learner here:). I mess up シ and ツ all the time- 😀 This really helped tysm 💓💓 Hi:)

Second, I was wondering if you have the katakana done like the mechanical.pencil hiragana video where you explain the placement of lines and spaces.  This is wonderful but I just wondered if you had a more detailed one.
Again thanks so much for your videos!

Let’s just appreciate the fact that this guy doesn’t have to do this but chooses to help us learn lets learn japanese why not
"シツンソノ".......this might take a while... rather than hearing asmrs it's wat better to see you writing Спасибо Такуми сенсей. Я под Вашим мудрым руководством выучил Катакану. С уважением из Хабаровска. ありがとうせんせい カカシせんせいDon’t forget to create your free account here! https://goo.gl/5iCDhS omgg this helped me o much thank you! I can't read kanji so i rely on the furigana on top :') The hirigana in between A and B is HA, so why does it sound like they're pronouncing it as WA? Omg, this was so helpful thank !! It would be much better if y’all write how you say the word in English this way it would be better and easier to say it People saying this videos too easy? I’m a new learner and this has helped so much At 10:15, supposedly if i want to ask my Japanese friend what's the time in japan, will i ask using this sentence?  "今、何時日本ですか？" 21:19 哇这个声音简直满足我这个声控，小姐姐的声音太好听了 Hey,  there are a lot of videos in this channel and I don't know in which order to watch them , someone please tell . みなさん、こんにちは！お元気ですか? A little bit creepy that it just turned 4 where I am when I got to the bit about the time. はじめましてのイントネーションがめっちゃ気になる well i can 100% say that i came out of this video with more knowledge than when i went in with I can read hiragana and katakana now, but I can't translate everything into English. I simply know the basic ones. When it comes to kanji, I have a hard time writing some of them and barely remember all of them. Nonetheless, I would continue to study. I'm not sure how long it will take me to master it, but one thing is for sure: improving myself requires dedication and hard work! :) がんばろう! I’m a bit confused. I’m hearing “Watashi wa” but the screen is showing “Watashi ha”. Bathroom with only 3 characters?  We need 8 in English! 

わたしはかわいいです Learning this so i can watch anime without subtitles Thank you, this is helping me, but i just wish this was slower, cuz when i start to understand something you just move on to the next sentece, and i dont want to pause all the time. Thank you for these videos！❤ In that I am not Larry part, I always say ではない。 私はふわふわです。

the meaning is double. i am fluffy, but i am also named fluffy. I will be back in two years, and by then I will know Japanese 2:33
This is one of the few times that I can happily say, yes, my name is indeed Ken! Thank you! Where can I find, Japanese for kindergarten..
I think I'm in that stage..
Because Ore nihonggo wakarenderstanden That’s really helpful thanks. 6:51 Thank you so much Why do you use は instead of わ in 私はです? It's confusing the crap out of me. i dont know hiragana or katakana or kanji so cant read that You are teaching japanese very well 14:57 can i ask ? why wa in the watashi(wa) words , it wrote ha in katakana , not wa ? It took 3 days but I’ve finally mastered this. 6:05
 you're welcome. Ok that video is acctualy very helpful The explanation of the grammar in this video is very correct even for me as a Japanese. You can study with confidence by watching this video. This video: "Japanese grammar for ABSOLUTE beginner"
People in the comments: "It'S tOo BaSiC!1!!!11"

Come on, it's like pretending to get a full quantum physics course from a child book. everyone, please stop  for a moment and appreciate that this is free.



~arigatogozaimas~ OMG finally. Thank you :) A video for my level. I am so happy. Ok. Question on the very first phrase..... ma-shi-te. It sound like mushtee. Why is the “i’ not pronounced? Is it silent? Thank you, please keep posting these lessons
Greetings from Iraq This is what I'm looking for, the pattern of grammar is composed before memorizing the vocabularies. All these language Pods are weird like 5-minutes crafts BUT they ACTUALLY WORK!!!! とてもたすかりました kaori? 😥 rest in peace Can't we say ください intead of おねがいします ? This is my level I’m to busy to learn new words so i only know a few and I know these grammar with a bit of other grammar I have been learning Japanese for a year now once a week in school i feel really disappointed in myself Ni in japanese is shi+ko in japanese Is sumimasen is both sorry and excuse me then what is gomennasai I want more grammar videos I got a Japanese ad hahaha ありがとうございます I've learn hiragana and grammar in 1 week thank you!!! 0:19 Basic sentence pattern (A は B)
4:04 Questions (~ですか)
5:04 Yes and No (はい　いいえ)
6:44 ko so a do (こ　そ　あ　ど)
9:46 Times (今)
13:14 Locations　(ここ　そこ　あそこ どこ)
16:22 Excuse me and Please (すみません　お願いします)
19:17 Negation (~ありません)
21:05 Past Tense (~でした) I am hard to learn💀 Let me just bookmark this real quick 12:49 😃 ありがとうございました！ どうもありがとう😭 POV: You have a speaking exam in one hour. Doumō arigatou gozaimasu 😊🇵🇭🇯🇵 When u watch too much anime, u find this video entertaining since u know most of the lessons already. I'm here so I can watch anime without reading the subtitles I think I'm really starting to understand this whole pitch accent thing in Japanese. Like, when they said "hajimemashite", I could hear the low and high pitches. It sounded like [ha - JI - ME - ma - sh' - TE]. Also, I'm starting to notice that, for certain moras ending in 'i' or 'u' sounds, when these are pronounced in low pitch, they become into what many English speakers would recognise as a schwa. Meaning, they sort of "disappear". It's really rather fascinating. I plan to start learning Mandarin Chinese in two weeks and, hopefully, recognising Japanese pitch accent will lead to recognising and emulating Mandarin Chinese tones. 14:00 Kanji is a mountain, grammar is the guy that sneaks up to you and shanks you while you're looking at the mountain 日本語の文とはヒンヂ語の文法同じです。 All the effort in learning Japanese language is a waste of time.

Let’s talk about the big elephant in the room.

Japan is located in the earthquake zone. There will be a big earthquake, and this will be followed by a big tsunami. This will completely destroy most of the Japanese islands. The few remaining northern islands will be taken over by the North Korea. So maybe it’s better to learn North Korean.

How do you say goodbye in Japan.....

Ah . . . Sayonara. Not getting last point becoz they r using Japanese words that's I don't know..I hope they use eng alphabets Ken desu can we get some F.. for JFK's nationality, in Japanese language once your dead you lose your nationality. OOF After watching so many anime learning Japanese become very enjoyable. i want to sleep.
my brain: 00:00 can someone tell me why the hiragana for ha is pronounced as wa when used as a particle? i love you 😆💕✨ございます❗‼️！！！ This channel has helped me so much! They teach it in a fun way! Thank you! I've learned more from this video than from other podcasts and lessons that were straight up too much for me, thx
Espacially since you also explain the particles ( I didn't know they were called particles before) 最初のはじめまして、から難しい
日本人ならなんでもHIで通じるから すみません/すいません also means thank you Basically A = B ( A wa B + des ( present ) desu ( past )  (+ ka if it is a question)

Also if a word start with “これ“  it means it’s close to the speaker but “それ“ means they are near the listener and “あれ” means there far away from both the listener and the speaker.  (Example これは何ですか。- what is this (this, topic, what, copula, question)

I might also add the dictionary of words and phrases used in this video later! i rlly need this, thanku Ich habe nur zur Hälfte angeschaut aber habe schon viel gelernt. Ausgezeichneter Kanal, Danke aus Argentinien! I actually stayed for the whole video, and it did teach me, ありがとうございます Vid: いいえ、ちがます= no, that's wrong
Me: oMfG dAnGaNrOnPa- 19:25 im not larry..
Me: Nani? Demo.. watashi wa larry desu HI KAZUMA DESU !!! just started learning japanese on you tube.found this video very helpful. learnt making a few beginner's sentences. Zura ja nai, Katsura da The guy has a really nice voice. shes a pirate? .....oh pilot. yes yes. Thank you so much for sharing these lessons here for free for us to learn. They helped me so much with learning and revising my japanese. Greatly appreciate!!! <3 All for you Pekora, witness me o ancestors 「か」for question is like 吗 in Chinese? Very helpful video Nice, I cant turn on audio because its to loud and my audio jack broke but I guess I can read basic hirangana but I get "shi" and "tsu" mixed up, alot. My voice just sound so ughhh I think it's more practical to learn Kanji at the same time as Grammar, it's very convenient to learn a Kanji meaning through a sentence or a question that you can use in conversation. 

The video is very useful ありがとうございます ありがと! This guy mumbles.Hey, pretty sweetie. What's your nationality? Thank you for romaji Japanese. 🙏 この役立つビデオを作ってくれてありがとう 2:44 Please write it down
2:52 Kawaí!
3:00 Sugoi!
3:14 Hai. 9:38 is simply wrong lol I dont know kanji how can I write down om notebook Wow, so hard to try this . 🇯🇵 Google translate has NO= Bango is this incorrect? Should I use iie instead when saying NO? I am a beginner of learning Japanese. How do I remember the vocabulary more effectively? Konbanwa=Good evening What a funny language!!! 😄😂😂😂😂!!! The audio says "kinkyuu" 緊急 urgent　while the video shows 救急 kyuukyuu emergency (first-aid) and she is geting a japan hoodie my littler sis knows theses and i dont i feel like the voice is creamin at me at the beginning Jyunichiwa Japanese any friend give me your Whatsapp number please Anyone japanes give me your Whatsapp number please Great video But it could have been better if it was English and Japanese so I can hear the translation as I go to the store. japane go ga wakarimasen i don’t even speak japanese but even i know some of these have errors and some of the phrases/words have multiple meanings Great video it could have been excellent, if they were speaking English also, so I can listen to it when the phone is in my pocket. 1:07 I thought it was Twice's Mina lmao good！ Question. I read that "toire wa doko desu ka" means where's the bathroom?  So could i say toire doko? How do u say these thing? I recommend the channel Japan Society if you wanna improve your japanese, and also I really liked the 5 episode, start from there, it's pretty easy Cảm ơn ad nhiều 4:02 (just to mark where I left off. I'm writing these down as flash cards :'D) toire wa do ko des ka do ko des ka nandes ka mochiron des ima konya gogo asa ashta kyo watashi wa haru gasii des wakari maska sama iee hai sugoi kaite kudasai yukkuri onegaisgimas sumi masen Janata wa do deska Genki Deska Sayonara Kamals Thank you so much for this,it's  explain everything really well I picked up some of these phrases while watching anime and singing JPop (I'm naturally good at languages so... But still, yay) I know good night in japan hello goobye nothing cute scary  yes and no because i watch anime a lot and because of it i learn how to talk or something in english so im so thankful to my brother and of course a nime 11:16 so that I can come back 14:02 One thing I would correct you on is that "watashi " is written in kanji 私は and not "わたし" Does anyone speak Japanese and English. I speak fluent English but I want to know jape nest so I can watch dragon ball super earlier and understand. Can anyone email me at hardymitchell1@gmail.com? Feel free if you want to help me! Until i watch japanese and some of these phrases matches I think everything is repeated several times, & there are a few mistakes, it seems. But in general a helpful video. what does the "gozaimasu" mean? What meaning does it contribute when you add it to "arigatou?" かわいい שפה ממש קשה Ehhh, you should probably not use sayounara casually. It's more like a final farewell, I believe. There are a few factors in teaching yourself to talk Japanese easily . One place I discovered that succeeds in merging these is the Japanese Magic Method (google it if you're interested) definately the best remedy that I've found. Look at all the great info . Kawaii spelled with 2 ii's? after watching tons of animes i alrdy
 understand all the 111 I am going is wrong,  please correct! Very intersted.. wa in hiragana is わ right? why does it say は (ha) all the time? That all of a sudden male  'hai' threw me off so much Shinzou wo sasageyo The problem with japanese is not the pronunciation, which is comparatively easy, but the fact to retain all the words and sentences that you need, which are completely different from English... Can I ask someone what is ittemasu i know only sugoi  from one piece . who's like mee I love this video. it is so helpful to me. it contains phrases I can use everyday. are these all hiraganas?? realy I like japanes language and I will try very soon to tech Japanese language Where the other Otaku's at? Good teaching video, clear and easy to learn. Thank you so much. how is good morning = ohayio
morning = asa 🙄 there is some mistakes...

はじめまして。 It’s summer break and my parents have been complaining that I don’t do anything, so I’m here trying to learn Japanese and also Arabic.
Then I can finally evolve into a qua-lingual.
Although, after those 2 languages, if I still want to learn more, I’ll try and learn Korean and Spanish. Frankly speaking.. Japanese language is actually easy to learn compared to Mandarin n Korean language.. Pronunciation is as easy as Malay Language.. Hajimaste.. Risa. Arigato!! Koniciwa Risa!!!Risa keire Urusen dayo = shut up

Learned it from Valorant Konnichiwa, Watashi Wa Mîlky Thê Idîøt ÙwÚ, desu. Teacher risa sound like my name but my name is riza Arigato Gozaimas I thought さよなら sayonara was used for a long goodbye? Like if someone was moving away or something? Dear Sensei, If the weather is good, would it be correct to say "tenki ga ii desu" or just omit the desu. ありがとうございます ! 😊 Risa ga kirei. Many of learn Japanese to watch anime ME: wants to learn Japanese cause I watch anime :)
*My parents thinking I am working hard for my future* :)
Me: •_• I'm shocked that educational content with that quailty is available for free on YouTube. Risa-sensei, domo arigatou! I love this! It really helps me with my japanese learning, Arigato! How are you beautiful so good Thank you for the hard work to develop such good lessons. I will learn from there. Who else is here because of anime? lol I know japanese enough so I can speak some nonsense after waking up and I love how I'm confusing my granny and mom, but if I ask my dad where my mangas are in japanese he's able to answer me even though he doesn't speak japanese. So I'm always laughing of my mom because dad can understand me and she can't ^^ Watashi wa Alvi/(Aruvu~i) Desu. 😊
watashi wa anata no sensei no Risa ga sukidesu. Anata wa totemo kireidesu. 😊 Arigato I can here to learn japanese, also she is a great teacher Always been my dream to learn Japanese but I'm having a hard time with the bigger words 8:20
Me: *cassualy getting a burger* i started learn English because i wanna learn Japanese, in English there are more sources to learn Japanese, but now i am stuck in english XD Thank you 😊 I dont know why, Risa sensei expression is very charming :) Thanks I can finally kill time i thought sayonara is when u say goodbye to someone. like bidding farewell and u wont see them in a long time. i didnt know it's for everyday use. thoughts? plz make a video about how to pronounce Shi. Dose it like SHoes in English. Many thanks Thank you thank you thank you! Arigatou Gozaimasu Risa Sensei! watashiwa pita desu Her expression while making this video really impressed me.😍❤️ お元気ですか、先生、はじめまして、私はインド出身です。日本語を勉強しています、ありがとう No- EA 😂😂 りさ先生ありがとうございます！ Please give the meaning of every japanese words and its use! Kire sense risa arigato sensei me: if i learn japanese i can speak to my japanese friend also me:But why do japanese people not just learn english. Does anyone else understand the difference between the use of "yoi" and "ii"? One of this, is in formal use? Thank you. Greetings from Argentina. Does sumimasen mean excuse me as I’m sorry or as in after you when you are trying to get past someone Guys I wrote it out so I don't forget Same here If there is (b,c,d,f,g,j,l,p...) in a sentence, how can i pronounce it or write it あいがと♥ Great! Please use watashi wa if you are a young boy or a female. Use boku no if you are a male I am learning japanese because i want to watch anime without subtitles ❤️🙏 omg I love the way she teaches , that gorgeous smile after each word\sentence i love it thank u sooo much
lots of love from INDIA \red heart emoji\ I’m confused on the “n” and “m” emphasis of her words.  Otherwise a great lesson! わたし  わ   みにくい とても　 きれい　 な　 りさ　 さん　です RISA SENSEIII, i'd prefer a faster pace tho How to i write my name Pradyut She's so cute f444444k Hello You are so sweet,sis ❤️ arigato sensai me da mucha risa I already knew some わたしは、あなたを愛しています !! 사랑해 Anybody here from watching anime like me... 2:49 Okay this is harder than I thought This is awesome keep doing more videos りせさんきれい hopefully i got it right 5:00, is this only for males? Because al the girls I heared in anime say something like *ahem* "iiaaaaaaaaaaaaa". すみませんMy suggestion for a song:  Sakura Hira Hira ,,,,(slowly,though !) what was that song..na na na na na na na na na na naaaaaaa Yo I can say McDonald’s in Japanese I don’t know how to spell it do you know how do My name in Japanese is like remonidesu…? i finished the entire video still nothing i remember hahaha is it because of risa's cuteness It’s not actually pronounced anime it’s pronounced uhnime Konnichiwa I learning japanese to watch anime I really like the songs unravel, haruka kanata and hikaru nara Anime brought me here!! wish me luck 
am starting today Arigoto! (Thank you!) One question:
 What does the difference of Sodesca or sodeska and sowka or soka XD I'm confused Yo I love risa’s energy 😆
I hope when I find my person in life she has the same kind 😂 Konichiwa りささん　あいしてる You know, those who belongs to India & knows HINDI can easily learn JAPANESE. Because, The translation  is mostly similar, the sentence structure is mostly similar and it goes words to words... How many you guys are like Japanese for anime










I think I am only one 😭 Am I a only girl who don't really watch anime but learning Japanese coz of literature? lol I luv Japanese literature me watching this but not doing my schoolworks 🤩 I am here to learn Japenese just to watch anime I am tired of reading subtitles and dubbed anime I feel like watching it in Japenese ai ni dekiru kotowa mada aru kai?
😅😅 One of the favourites...💖💖 I swear everyone here is trying to watch anime without subtitles while I just here chilling trying to learn my third language I honestly just wanna speak and understand my fav Vtubers on their streams 👁️💧👄💧👁️ people think im learning japanese to watch anime 





*i just wanna annoy my cousin because he thinks watching anime helps to learn japanese* NO MORE SUBTITLES FOR ME Is Japanese pod 101 account safe?? I really don't like your silliness format.  That's not why I came here.  I don't want to waste my time!  Not for me..... Why I want to learn Japanese:
1%=cuz I wanna impress my friends
0.2%=cuz I wanna see Japanese culture
0.8%=so I can abuse someone in Japanese 
98%=so I can see anime without subtitles Believe it or not I can't properly watch AoT with subtitles I'm just here cause I wanna understand anime I'm an OTAKU but still struggle to speak nihongo😅🇯🇵 the only thing that I can suggest is it would be better
to have a subtitle of letters on how to pronounce the words. thank u 🤣🤣こんにちは兄弟ここで新しいことをどうやってやっていますか？ I randomly decided that I wanted to start learning Japanese. COMBINING THIS With duolingo for fastest learning The only reason I learn... Anime When you're 12 and you're learning on Duolingo That's why i want to study japanese because of japanese girls are so beauty.. Am I the only one genuinely wanting to go to Japan bc it’s Japan not bc of anime? Im the small percentage that just wants to play PC Engine RPGs I know I can't learn Japanese this fast in just one hour, but I will be practicing, also I'm trying to learn Spanish. i want to learn japanese because i find it a complex language for only english speakers to learn hah That bass at 23:00 is sicc Just so that we are clear I am just here because I just want to watch RE: ZERO without looking at the subtitles all the time. All the seasons i watched in anime has paid off a but still more room to improve Risa saying: THE NEXT STOP IS TOWER BRIDGE under her breath 🤣🤣 great I'll do the same with japanese trains I just wanna be a brown  British guy and shock japanese natives with fluent japanese 🤣 Subtitles turn off now Thank you. Before this all I knew has “Omae wa mou shinde iru...NANI” for purposes you can guess. I need this in romaji so I can pronounce it better 36:52 1:03 Japanese counter left the chat Tiny little auduritum or something What if i live in india. How do i practice japanese? Any special tip? i wonder how my brain is working when i haven’t slept for more than 20 hours, and i’m trying to learn a language (japanese) in another language (english) that isn’t my native language..lmao Meg's voice reminds me of Jaiden Animations How many of you are indians and watching this video to watch japanese anime without sub titles reasons why I want to learn Japanese :
- for my resume so my employers can see that I'm multilingual 
- to be able to be more serious when it comes to studying 
- to be proud of myself,  I guess 
- and watch anime without subtitles 

it's going to be a long, long journey, see you guys in 5 years love how almost all of us just wanna watch anime and be able to look away from the screen to do a simple task 😂 Tired of subtitles of animes🥵🥵!
A new beginning here 😈😈 Bruh, if you pay attention to anime you could easily pass all begginer stuff and head straight into grammar, I watched three begginer vids and nothing was new. I watched this so i can talk to my waifu on my dreams, im so tired of listening to her speaking english I have a bad case of diarrhea. The verb lesson should have the verbs written in latin alphabet as well. I don't know japanese alphabet and I am very visual, so japanese verbs in latin alphabet would be very beneficial for people like me. I thought Anna is Filipino, because of her accent. anyone click this video just to sound like someone from an anime series God bless my own.  Just don't asm


To answer any questions did she ever hike mount fuji Were all my anime lovers at? I try hard to learn Japanese but I donno it not getting in my head 😔 I started learning Korean today I took my first lesson which was basic conversation 😅 🙃,but hope I get a Japanese friend 🤗 if you r a Japanese please 🙏🥺🥺 be my friend I’m literally Meg. I’m ethnically japanese and I lost my ability to speak as I grew older so here I am _in£inlli   t  yll    op s Might as well learn the language since I live in Japan now I am Indian and I want to learn Japanese. Can someone help me? 21:35 I remember going to get the groceries that got delivered and since the person that came only knew Arabic and i can’t speak it.The person asked me if I wanted water and because I understood but wanted to reply quickly I said hai(yes) instead of na’am [(yes)in Arabic] Gathering japanese speakers in the philippines is like gathering noncorrupt officials. Meaning, its impossible. Just Skip to 15:55 The problem is I don't have Japanese friends🧐 at some point, in every person's life, anime will eventually bring you here. Me stressing over the Japanese alphabet 15:50 よ here's  several ideas for how to learn Japanese
Decide exactly why you want to speak japanese
Try to speak japanese everyday
Find which process works for you best.
(I read about these and more on Fergs magic blueprint site ) Me: I'm bored let's learn Japanese so I can watch anime. My explanation: music I love jpop, Utaite and other stuff and sometimes I watch anime but not a lot i get angry easily so my time to shine and say what ever. (jk) 😬😒😏 Can someone who has already watched part of or the whole video tell me if it was actually helpful for them? i am here because I want to watch anime that are without subtitles We all now we just want to learn japanese because we gonna go to Japan in the future Hey. What is the differences between 
貴様。 = kisama  =  you 
君は。 = kimi wa  = you
お前。 = omae     = you
あなた = anata     = you
And another, one.  It sounds like 'washiou' if im not mistake.  You can find it on anime naruto vs nine tail.  Is it something like Chinese mandarin, hokkien, Cantonese? is it just me or is she Similar to Kim Yo Jong? uwu Fun fact: 50% of the viewers are weebs including myself This is useless i didnt learn anything It's so fun watching your videos! K-jin was so cuteeeee. :D Everyone: I want to watch Anime without subtitles

Me: Just wants to learn another language I really want to learn Japanese and be able to watch anime without subtitles,  or read the raw of mangas who else just here to watch anime XDIf we get 2000 Likes on this video we will release a new video with more conversations! This lesson is really good This is SOOOOOO helpful, thank you. 21:46 😍😍 vibing with the "honnn" inbetween each story The amount of detail in the background noise is amazing Japanese people are speak rapidly 😭😭😭 ya şu videoların pdf i olsa ya yazmaktan imanım gevredi yemin ediyorum I feel like a movie is going on... it's so fun to listen this...😀 The longer I listen, Why do I feel like I'm listening to a romance story between these two XDD now I want the visuals XD My Crunchyroll subscription sure helped me a lot on this XD That guy's pretty weird, I mean who buys a present to a girl you just met for the first time? I am reading aloud scary stories in Japanese.
My Youtube channel name is "岡 勝秀の 怖い話の朗読".
I hope you enjoy it. Togarashi is hot pepper in general not a direct translation of Jalapeno.. Taylor most be a single dad, or as the Japanese would say "a playboy". He seems to spend a lot of time with Kaori... Kaori does not seem to mind. This female voice is perfect to teach, "Yamete Kudasai ahhhh"... Is it me or do they sound like they are having sex and he grunts and she high pitch ;like she is about o pop When you realize that these same phrases , voice and characters are also in their app in absolute beginner series audio lessons 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 0:53 Isn't I m sorry is Gomenasai ?
I can be wrong btw The best way to learn a language is to converse in it Literally i can understand 80 to 90 %without subtitles or seeing at screen 😲 I got scared Muttley wasn’t on this world anymore before he said he just left Muttley in California when he went to Japan 😓 Sarah loves bananas but hates men, remarkable personality All teaching phrases are good as they're commonly used in daily life, but the amount of waiting time between phrases are probably too much. I legit know most of the words. Guess the anime and studying paid off Masato is best boy 16:02 sounds like the French “Ça va” for “How are you?” Is it a loan word? I’m a slow learner, so can somebody help me with it? I love that I understand a lot of this listening, still gotta improve my reading though👌👌 im actually happy, with this i feel like i get close to 90% of it, whereas some of the other beginner ones feel like just filling in blanks, and i have to look at the screen to figure it out This conversations are all so polite, so different on the conversation in anime 5:58 So fast 👎 1 .  Oishiiiii

After toire wa doko deska 
😂 same me can you maybe make a video like this, but with how you would spell it wtf this is the best video! 27:37 that does not mean "are you all right?" LOL it means "weird face" 😗wait smn told me ppl didnt say just “domo” I wish to learn japanese, subscribed in 2021! Thanks to anime I know 90% of it😭 24:05

Is this mistranslated??? Thanks. I can’t stop smiling because I clicked on this for fun thinking about learning it and my name is being used in here likee?what a coincidence I am learning Japanese just to watch anime😅😅I can't understand a bit of it.... I am writing all this down to practice writing. This channel is amazing. 0:45 😫😩😫 why they dont have romanization i mean like words its only japanese alphabet hayy how can i read or understand its spelling Arigato gozaimasu Okay now but with kanji... Hope you all realize this is barely enough to get by in Japan once you visit. 非常に難しい。 easy OHIO "Nice to meet you. I'm Kaori."

Me: *Feelings of April intensify* And in the end they fell in love This video seems highly effective and awesome when combined with note-taking. I have spent months studying studying Japanese online and found a great website at Fergs Magic Blueprint (check it out on google) here's  a few suggestions for how to learn Japanese
Decide precisely why you want to speak japanese
Try to speak japanese everyday
Decide what method works for you best.
(I discovered about these and more on Fergs Magic Blueprint website ) Not certain about the points made but ,if anyone else wants to discover best way to learn japanese online try Sovallo Amazing  Japanese  Fixer (just google it ) ? Ive heard some awesome things about it and my colleague got excellent success with it. Can someone tell me why the little circle is behind the "su" character at the end of the sentence? ( 0:20 ) 

I see it all the time, but i have no idea what it means. Does it mean that the spelling of the word is not DESU, but only "DES" as it sounds? 

Please clear this up for me someone :( these dialogues are so easy but at the same time so fun to listen to! not me trying to learn korean and japanese at the same time 9:21 lmfao お水 sounds nicer yes? And fr I knew like 80% from anime hahahaha I just waited for 6:34 I just realized the sound effect on this video is sound effect from Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 5 Please add a word caption pleaseeee onegai I guess people dont watch the video till the end. There's clearly a wrong translations of phrases from 24:10 until 24:17 but I digress. Doumo Arigatou for the good video. This is usefull vedio but speakers speak at high speed(fast) .it will be usefull for beginners if you speak at normal speed   than repeat the sentence at very slow speed and then at normal speed again.
Arshad lahore pakistan hajimemashite kaori desu

me: *cries Am i the only one hearing Naruto sounds in the background? TOO MANY ADDS!. DouShite? if they were in japanese/ergrish, I wouldn't mind. 7:57 confirmed sarah chan is a lesbian taylor-san the perfect protagonist😭 Taylor sounds like rock lee Mistakes in translation all over. I like these ! Make more Im learning and also imagine them in my mind like im watching anime So it's gender differences in some of the phrases? Ahhhhh I can’t believe high quality audio practices like these are actually freeeee!!! JapanesePod101 you’re the besttt Where did they hire these anime voice actors "good morning" in japanese it's literally the state of Ohio 😂😂😂 if you live in Ohio you already know how to say "good morning" in japanese hahahah Too fast,  not ideal for learning. I like how native speakers say anime isn't a very good way to learn Japanese, but these dialogues sound like they're strait up taken from an anime hahaha I feel duped by the thumbnail. No Risa in video ;-; When he said Here's a Gorilla i pictured Shinpachi, Otae and Kondo san at a zoo I swear if you listen to this with your eyes shut,  your brain makes its own anime.  😄 haikyuu loud boys be like:  3:45 i love it so helpful💗 thank you for uploading ✌ *A SHORT NOTE FOR ME*

It's very informative if one wishes to learn being the way you interpreted is very crystal clear .Have you created any playlist (series)to go through in details to learn from basics or it's introductory.pls let me know.I really appreciate your remarkable representation.Thanks a lot with regards from all of my heart ❤️.

ü: try to speak an उ and form your lips if you are speaking an इ. 
Its sounds similar to an इ and it is difficult to explain, because in English and Indian languages this vocal don't exist.
In the Turks and Chinese language it exists: Atatürk, or Chinese nü   女 . 
ö is al little similar like the i in English "sir". 
ä ist like the a in English "bad" or in Hindi  है! 
Ich bin Deutscher, jedoch besitze ich Kenntnisse in Sanskrit! (I am German and have some knowledge about संस्कृतम् ) Hello mam main german classes lgana chahti hun pls tell me online classes kaise lag a sakte hain Sanskrit is not Mother of German. German has its origin in Germanic sub family. Ancestor of Germanic sub family is sister to old Latin. Old Latin and Greek, old Lithuanian are all sister languages.  These languages had a precursor which is now extinct. That precursor language is sister to old avestan and Sanskrit.
Also Sanskrit is not mother of 'all' languages. Sanskrit is mother of North Indian languages. बहुत शानदार 
धन्यवाद ।So, many of you ask a common doubt about one alphabet: N. People ask that N has a vowel in Na. So, let me clear this. Na and N are two different alphabets. Na sound is ना and  N sound is "Chaand Bindi" on an alphabet as in सँ (Sound from Nose). So, both are different alphabets and N does not have vowel with it because it itself sounds like a vowel. I love japanese learning asthma 😙😙😙 Dii so do u watch anime without sub ? Most of students are coming here to learn japnese for anime.

Alg feel ayegi na pure japnese me dekhne ke liye 😅 In japan shinchan is called shinosuke Sayoonara(さよおなら） Vshs arigatogozaimasu sensei I already knew Doraemon pronounciation from Namaste Kohei Kya tum muj se sadi krogi I love you👀😍 Konichiwa,onyohasseyo , origato When she said bohot he famous cartoon hain jo batchpan se hum dekhtein aiye hai....I was like yeah that's Naruto but it's not cartoon it's anime then she said Doremon...owoww ok Watching for anime 😂 Mujhe Japanese class Sek na hai kyuki mujhe Japan me gana hai 1. DONE Doraemon anime hai cartoon nhi !! Apna kaha ki N ka sath koi vowel attached nhi hota to 1st example ma kasa hua ha Bhai kisko lagta he doreamon he japan me Chalo ab thoda naruto ma smj to ayega 😅 japanese looks interesting now its time to learn it and watch every anime existed 🏃‍♀️ Your sound is like nobita Didi lekin upar to NA he na to N exception kaise hua Who came for anime 🌚🌝 Now no need for subtitles in anime😁 Thank you mam I also really wanted to learn japanese 
Iam learning from an app duolingo Sasukeee ठीक से हिंदी बोलना तो सीख लो हिंगलिश निकलती

Then Lamborghini in Japanese Ramborgini Great job Mam please make more videos on japanese language courses🙏❤ Japanese language to humare Assam k Assamese language se thoda thoda comon lagta h... Jaise ki Canada  ko canada , America ko America a nahi aa sound ati h humare bhi 😁😁Get your FREE account here : https://goo.gl/8jUPbX Ok, ok, but as an American, I have to ask. What if you can only use chopsticks with one hand, and that hand just so happens to be broken? Fascinating. Wristbands keep them handy. umm... is it just me, or is that bathwater going to be like a total breeding ground for STIs lol... like im not doing that unless im the first person to use the bathwater. The only thing is i dont want to be disrespectful to the culture, but umm... that actually seems fairly unsanitary to me, even if you did shower before hand and even if it does save water... personally i would just skip the bath if someone else used it. I think it would be more practical for everyone living in the house to have their own dedicated night each week to have more time than the others in the house in the bathroom to take a bath to themselves- one, because then no dirty bathwater, two, because honestly, no one needs a whole bath every day lol, and three, because it wont take up as much time in one evening for one person to have a bath rather than the whole family... also how are you supposed to relax in a bathtub when people have already been in it, and the water is probably cold then anyway... and dirty, ew. also if you still have to get out for another person, the water will be even colder and dirtier for them, and how are you supposed to relax for awhile if your rushed to get out for someone else so its not too cold for them and/or so you dont use the bathroom the whole night? sheesh. Seems overly complicated to me lol. As much as i admire how productive and neat and responsible japanese culture is, and how much they value tradition, i also think its a good idea to differ from those traditions sometimes, and also to remember that work isnt what life is all about lol. One of the main reasons i may not move to japan when im older (i want to, but it depends) is simply because there is such an emphasis on worklife and on staying overtime (why? you have a set amount of work hours a day- in my opinion, your taking away from family and your own life by doing that, and it seems like bad worksmanship if you cant get the required work done in the hours you have. At least thats the outlook in sweden. If you leave late in sweden, its considered that you arent an efficient enough worker, and that you dont take enough time for yourself, thus, arent going to be as good at your job because you dont take care of yourself. anyway thats my take on things- still love japanese culture in general though. Incredible as usual 🤩🤩🤩🤩 thank you very much 😇😇☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ strange and abnormal culture. You have a Japanese style meeting in a room or space with 2 seats... You should sit according to your seniority!!  Your boss should sit at a place, which is at four right angles, to the managers place in the restaurant... while you must sit at the corner! ... so your boss can stare at the hot girls and not you! Also, make sure that your boss is sitting 3 centimetres above you... and you are sitting 4 cm below your boss. Always keep a tape ready to measure this ! Make sure you measure while your boss is away !!🤯




saRcASm!! ソ  バエ  エム  アエ  ラルニング  デス ?  ソ ダト  アイ  カン  アンダスタンド  ヲト  イス  ハッペニング  イン  アニメ。 ( ó~ ò ") Sorry! Kind of creepy and depressing how every breath taken is structured with precise rules.

I mean how do Japanese go about their day abroad without all these rules? They must be completely lost and helpless. Why all the commercials? that they did the effort to add reverb in the bathroom scene is hilarious So much fun to watch and learn ❤️ 7:00 3:28 ♥~ara ara~♥ Arigatou im learning from Philippines 🇵🇭❤️🇯🇵 If we don't wanna drink (or eat ) so what should we say to them? What happens with the drinking parties if you don’t drink? I love japan Arigatou thank you Please review translation.  There are mistakes in translation. There are some similarities in the U.S, like offering your seat to someone who’s crippled. They usually have designated seats for elderly, pregnant women, crippled, or bigger people. That’s only on the bus tho A brit visiting Japanese home would be interesting どうもありがとうございます ! ❤ I got learn more of this very interesting video Culture po ba yan o norms? Haha, nice instructive video. :# I dont know but I guess any other part of civilized world we take shoes of when we enter indoors, other than U.S. of America.."#1 country" ^^ 13:44 daamn idk if this is different for like, retail or fast food in japan but me n my coworkers peace out as soon as our shift ends. someone's hands could fall off in the deep fryer and id be like damn thats crazy anyway see yall tomorrow nice video　ありがとう Mom sounds like a anime character Muito bom saber....mille grazie..👌👍👍 No podrían poner subtítulos en español? It is the best site to learn Japanese language 👌🏻 really my language improved so much 13:18 is it bad that i know exactly where this was from? sakura blade, a game on android. it realy helps Naw, I'm going to watch jojo I think that yes some thing the video said ARE very politely. but l don't thing japonese people do all of them. it's like farting in public, yes , it's wrong but you still do. you get what l am saying ? ill be fine.. I'm a master anime fan. Very helpful, thank you Risa and the rest of you guys, stay safe! Thanks for the great video!! Very useful video😊どうもありがとうございます。 I need romaji for this... 😭 6:07 Is there any particular rule if you are left handed? Need to update it with masks... Lol God America has so much to learn about manners lmao I expected to hear about theatre and other cultural stuff was Lisa not feeling well? she looked like she cried or something How many times do you clap when the strippers come in? Too many rules. Japanese people really need to chill out. こんなふうに日本が見られているのだとわかって新鮮だった
I’m learning English I only knew how to say "konnichiwa" & "sayonara"! ^;^ I just realized how rude American culture is lol Manners in the train also apply in Korea as well!! Geez everyone is so polite that there are literally videos about respecting it i cant wait to leave shitty america :,( Honda Civic. It's beautiful inheriting another culture and learning it. How I love being unique. So you have to stand a specific way in the elevator too. The culture is very specific and organized wow. I waant to have a friends from japan😅❤ I swear if I didn't see this video I would have looked rude and disrespectful one with the vending machine that is so cool can't wait to see one one with the vending machine that is so cool can't wait to see one Sory  No English.only Nepali from japanis My Mexican culture is different from the Japanese culture and I amdrie it I'm a Chinese. I feel Japanese culture is so similar to Chinese in this video. After I've watched this video I realized my country has no manners to eat food lol I'm learning <3 But my fudanshii thoughts about ben and taichi is distracting me T-T Beautifull people This is the greatest anime of all time. That clapping killed me I whish they put one about going  to Brothels manners in japan i need it so badly Why am I watching this? I’m Japanese 輪さぱのフラロご こにちわ！ Longest 30 minutes in my life. Lol, so people who sit in the back of the car are the most important? That's where children and old people sit in the West, AKA, the two dumbest people in society. Ben sounds like deku from my hero academia dubbed It's well put together! i don't like taking baths i prefer taking showers kufhkudhwud I:love thus  videos Lisa is sooo pretty Ya... i cant work for a Japanese company, seems like i'll get fired for being assertive. thats what i like abt Japanese, they hav the same sense of manners and politeness as Hindus.... Risa is the best <3 Let's just appreciate these pronunciations (this is not intended to be rude)


Japanese accent when you need to make the L sound: HERRO


Japanese accent when you need to make the R sound: ALLIVED Thank you for the video. Very useful! Would guests have to use the same bath water? 6:54


why have i seen the main character do this in  anime? The Numbers of ad‘s are horrible. If everyone uses the same bath water, won’t it eventually go cold or warm and no longer hot. 3:27 im confused why is it "de" i thought it should be "ga" is it multiple ppl = de and singular = ga? I can't watch this it's making anime boring. Senpai means senior? I always thought it meant cute. Like Jake-Senpai. Im not Jake-Senior. I'm not your dad. unless of course you would like me to be your "daddy." 💪😘✌ im not even going to japan..... Good to know how I commonly eat is manners and I didn’t even know. Except when I shove food down my throat 😅 A lot of the train rules actually just sound like stuff I do even in Canada though. I’m now wondering if it’s not a thing people do already or not. These courtesies are not indigenous to Japan, it’s just common sense which can be applied in any country under similar circumstances....with the exception of China, of course....those people are just hopeless when it comes to common courtesy, sanitation, and general social graces. Truth is truth, take it or leave it. If they don't move when you say excuse me you threaten them with a Thousand Years of Death This video is very helpful Japanese people are the most complicated ones on earth. It is very difficult to adapt to their culture. I am from Thailand, and in my country people are flexible with much less pressured way of living.Get your FREE account here: https://bit.ly/2UKS3Ed 8:46 (my time) I'm 11 years old and i am learning Japanese for fun so this really helped, thank you. I want to learn. my x is going to be so confused when i start speaking japanese ME:  minding my business 
man I don’t know : OI OI OI 🦋 Excuse me, I want put question.. This words kanji? How we should use kanji? In names thing or no? And how we can write person name?, when we will write it what we will use? Katakana or hiragana? I hope someone say any comment 😿💗. 0:37 saving this cause im too lazy to write 200 words in my japenese notes I'm learning japenese cause I wanna make a japenese Chanel about slime and I wanna get famous and I also wanna watch anime without subtitles Idk why I'm here 😅😂I already know Japanese .... Just to see how crazy you all are.. Ohayo arigato 3:17 is "can" as in "I can do that" and not "a can of tomatoes" I just wanna read about my favourite TV shows that are written in Japanese newspaper articles, so far l learnt the following in the past 3 days...

"Wait a minute."
*me realises Aoi Kanzaki is a character from Demon Slayer* Watashiwa ai taberu K but why do i need to know what eakon means I wonder how many basic words of each language do you need to learn to be able to roughly understand every language. what is the meaning ok KAMEHA ME HAAA? 6:29 bookmark Some if them sound Spanish to me ugh I really wish I could speak this beautiful language kurejittokādo

this Japanese pronouciations are strange 
by Japanese here's  several suggestions for how to learn Japanese
Decide precisely why you wish to speak japanese
Try to use japanese everyday
Decide which process works for you best.
(I discovered about these and more from Fergs Magic Blueprint site ) although some of these might be wrong, I know that many of them are correct. because one side of my family is fully Japanese, I hear them say many of these words and I even have to learn these words too beer is pronounced "hi-ru"? Aoi Aoi _____ I thought katakana is only for names? is every foreign word can be written in japanese ? I am a Assamese girl i know Hindi Assamese but I want to know many languages like Japanese 13:00 bookmark ok I really really would love to speak fluent Japanese, but I have ADD and really struggle to learn, especially memorising new things ): I'm just here because of twisted wonderland I'm 14 and trying to teach myself Japanese Glad I’m not the only one who speaks it but is here for the comments ㇼサどこですか？ ^-^ IS IT ME OR DOSE GOGO SOUND LIKE GONO some of these are pronounced oddly (not japanese so maybe i’m wrong but from what i know i heard few) me still now knowning how to say knowchiwa Next time i say my clothes are wet imma say 
Watashi no "Fuk u" wa nurete imasu in an english accent What is the difference between 高価 and 高い? Don't they both mean expensive? Aoi aoi- (insted aoi bird lyrics here) 7:08
What is the differernce between "takai" and "kouka"? ഹായ് ഇത് ഏത് language ആണ്.. Watashi baka? Japan The only reason im here watching this video is because im forcing my self too and teach my " totally knows Japanese  cousin ". Unchi. Your so beautiful Risa Now to go create two thousand flashcards in sets of two hundred. (i know i have to do more than just that but that sounds fun bc im insane og) I know japanese

Pencil: I would like to express my great respect for you usind 2 simple expressions: the first one would be "hi", a simple way to approach people and start a conversation. The second one would be "how are you/are you fine?" A simple and effective way to help the communication to be a little bit more polite. Japanese is nice language Thank you for the video Some words are wrong in this ._. yeh I think you have mistaken seeing this video or comment just wala kang jowa mutiny! where's Risa!

- Get your FREE account here https://goo.gl/tW2Uu2 wow. just by watching anime and japanese streamers, i got most of these right. except for the questions with names of the week. i got them all wrong 😂 being exposed to the language really helps a lot. 😮 I only study by myself, while working. I spend at least an hour reading, memorizing words, and understanding the grammar, I already have memorized Hiragan and Katakana. I started just a month ago.

I tried answering this, I understood some words and the context but still having a hard time answering the question. What I am doing is I'm trying to anticipate what will be asked based on the words that I understood. 

Am I doing something wrong? Or I am doing just fine? Considering my situation? 

If someone cares to answer, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you! I can understand nearly all of it now WHAAAAT! anyone else is like able to understand some things  but not most things? like you can kinda get it based on the parts you understand but not fully? 日本人なのに日本語の勉強してる。 僕は一つ月から日本語を勉強しています。ついに最初のセクションを理解しました。毎日勉強するは良かった。ありがとう！（僕はドイツ人）:)

(Also I advise you to learn Kanji, it really helped me) Continue to learn, even if it's very hard at the beginning. If you have questions how I learn Kanji, just ask im here everyday
がんばって！ im here everyday!

がんばって！ 英語ネイティブになった気分 I came back here after studying japanese for a week... I'm glad I have understand now more what they are talking about hueheueheu Is this N4? Just got back into learning Japanese again after months of not studying it, and tbh I'm surprised i got some words here and there so i understood what they could be talking about. But it's still really really really hard to understand Ive been at it for a month now and understood less than 5% of the first one :( How did the guy in the glasses shop know the round glasses didn't suit him if he can't see? 🤔 これはちょっと可愛すぎるなぁ…(ええやん)
あぁ…高すぎますね(日本人の心もないやん) I’ve been teaching myself Japanese for the past 1.5 year so I’d say in general I’m around jlpt n4 level, but somehow I kinda forgot I needed to do listening practice until a little over a month ago😬 I’m a little confused since some jlpt n5 listening practices are crazy easy while some other ones I feel dumb. but then on the other hand, this is more jlpt n4 and its not too bad. ig everyone has a different view on the levels🤷🏼‍♀️ I'm reading aloud scary stories in Japanese.
My Youtube channel name is "岡 勝秀の 怖い話の朗読".
I hope you enjoy it. 草っていう言葉、外国の友達に説明しづらいよ草 I'm N4 and can make my way through most of this, but it's still tricky and i have to look up words. Def not what people think of as "Beginner" And I am going through all of this only for watching anime with no subs... Of corse I am. It’s worth it. omg few months ago, i started to learn japanese and the first time i listened to this its kinda hard. but now i can understand and get the thought of the phrases. im so happy of my achievement, think im gonna cry lol :') ありがとうございます the translations for these sentences are so bad, it makes it super hard to learn unless you already know what they're saying. 「はい、ですから、ドアのよこの本だなの上にはおけませんよ。」should be translated to "yes, because of that, we can't put it on top of the bookshelf next to the door." instead ですから was translated to "too bad" (not what that means at all), and then the next part had things like "it would be nice" and "but there's only room for one printer there," which is just not what they're saying at all. it makes it a more natural translation, but it makes it impossible to match the japanese version with the english version to figure out the words/what they're saying. Guys don't worry if you don't get it at first, just listen to it over and over again until you understand it and practice listening and you will get it I like it I understood the first 7 seven line and I understood the jist of the first conversation. But got the answer wrong. this encouraged me to broaden my japanese vocabulary D: ネックレスの四択問題について最大の疑問は　
何故この店には四つしか商品が無いのか？　笑 It's a N4 level I guess, I finished N5 level, and I can understand or guess most of them but some words are from N4 or sometimes higher, the speed is a N4 level too I think. But this is a great way to improve yourself if you achieved N5 and started to learn N4. There's a lot of a new vocabulary. Also I recommend you to listen it once, then twice if needed, and mainly to write by yourself what you hear, and then correct it after with the video. But it is important to write down by yourself because you think you are really pushing yourself to understand all the words, not just an idea of what you hear :) didn't understand the 2nd problem. the answerwould be " near the window " but it showed newr the gate... can anyone help me out plz. ネッ・クレス　みたいな言い方ww 6 months of Duolingo and I'm catching about 75% of what's going on. I get the gist of it but miss a few things here and there. I'd say beginner is appropriate for this. The conversations are fairly simple and the grammar use is as basic as possible. 3 years in and...nope.  Too fast for me.  I really need to work on listening exercises more. AH I THOUGHT 1 BEER WASNT ENOUGH I'm bad at English (Maybe B2-C1) but I also want to learn Japanese. How naive of me. I only got about 50% of what was being said oof なんか草 Desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu I consider myself beginner-intermediate, and this was difficult for me, but I could get the gist of most of the conversations. Sometimes I wouldn't understand crucial information about the conversation. I wouldn't say this is beginner level, but it is a good video. 英語をもっと頑張ろうと思った。
I wanted to do my best in English. While speaking was easier for me, this is a perfect exam to train my listening, which I had huge problems with. Also my vocabulary developed instantly. After watching it again I already understood most of it, without forgetting, which happens to me quickly, when just writing down vocabulary in a notebook. The grammar in these tasks is very simple, since it is for beginners. That was maybe too easy for me to learn anything, but I guess that's also not the point. The talking speed is perfect. It's a bit slower than casual talk, but not so much, that it sounds completely out of place. Great job! I'm going to continue learning with this platform. ＠3:50, why is 起きる used for placing? I thought it meant to get up or wake up? すさゆさわぬらさや Japan language ia easy to listen for indonesia Why can I understand it but not actually speak these things of my own accord Is this really beginner? 
I am in the second Minna no Nihongo right now, thought I try more some listening exercise..
And I got nothing. :/ This is definitely not N5 material. A useful practise tool but it's a shame it's labelled as beginner. It becomes demotivating. "Beginners comprehension"
*Starts*
Me: "doesn't understand a single word!" 
Don't think this is for absolute beginners lol I guess beginner means learning from 1 year < I've been studying Japanese for almost 3 years and this is just about my level I'm so happy that I got everything right! (I watched until the first part) btw I've been studying for around 3 and a half months everyday. I highly recommend Japanese ammo with Misa's channel!! I don't even have a textbook! Anyways, 皆さん、頑張ってくださいね！諦めないで。これからもっともっと練習します。 it's not for Beginners... there so much vocabulary I don't know so I don't get the major informations この人絶対奥さん好きじゃないだろw sometimes the english subtitles at the bottom were very different from the meaning of the japanese ones though. I'm studying for the JPLT N4/N3 and I found this video perfect for learning since I could understand most of the sentence but still had to look up many words. I feel like this is harder than the sample questions for JLPT N4 Begginer would be questions like, "whats your favorite color?" or "how old are you?". This channel is a horrible way to learn. They speak blazing fast and don't actually TEACH you anything, they only bombard you with complex sentences. If you can understand everything in this video, you're not a fucking Begginer, you're fluent and can easily live in Japan. I know because I live in Tokyo. I really hate it when learning resources give super loose and localized translations over more accurate ones.  For example,  いらっしゃいませ。何をおさがしていますか。This carries the same sentiment of "may I help you?", but a MUCH closer translation might be "welcome.  What are you looking for?"  It won't always sound totally natural in English, but it's FAR more useful when you're trying to learn the language and need to understand what you're actually saying and not just how to repeat stock phrases.  Or like in the first sentence, where did they get the thing about the jewelry shop?  I realize that's implied from the scene, but putting that in the translation is incredibly misleading since nothing in the Japanese mentioned a jewelry shop.  Please, the production values on these videos are excellent, but give us better translations.  You're writing a learning resource, not translating a TV show. 大抵こうなる

｢いらっしゃいませ。何をお探しですか？｣
『あ、妻の誕生日プレゼントを探してて…何かおすすめとかありますかね』
｢そうですねー。このネックレスはいかがですか？｣
『あー…もうちょい短めのやつってありますかね』
｢それでは、こちらのお花のネックレスか、ハートのネックレスはいかがですか？｣
『あー…妻にはちょっと…』
『あ、このパールのやつっていくらですか？』
｢こちらは10万円です｣
『あー…………やっぱり最初の長いやつで』
｢はい、こちらですね｣ this channel doesn't seem to know what beginner means........... So the definition of beginner has changed Is this N4 difficulty?
My grammar and vocabulary isn't bad, but I really need to catch up with listening, since I do self-study. I'm learning for N4 at the moment. いや、これは文章が酷すぎる。
｢最初に見たのにします。｣みたいな略後はダメでしょ…
正しくは｢最初に見た物にします。｣ wow i love this.
new friend here
Godblessdaily❤❤❤ 英語のリスニングもこんなんなのかなぁ？ww What 😂 I can only undertand half of the conversations 😂😂 At 3:41, I'm wondering what "hanashiatteimasu" means exactly, "hanasu" is "to speak" and "hanashimasu" is the Masu form of the verb. On the other hand "atteimasu" is the conjugation of either the verb "au" or "aru". I suppose this is a similar grammatical construction as "*pre-masu form of verb* + dasu/hajimeru" which means "to start *verb*ing". My problem is that I can't understand what effect this particular grammatical construction has on the meaning. It seems to me (from the English translation provided in the video) that if we had used "hanashiteimasu" then we'd have the same meaning. Anyone knows the distinction ? I would really appreciate the help! Actually a great way to spend the night at 2 AM... really helpful practice though for N4/N3 level, thank you very much! Everyone in the comments is saying it's N3 and super hard but all of the grammar except maybe a few points is N4 and it's pretty easy all things considered. They speak really slowly compared to real life Japanese and don't use any slang or drop any particles like in more casual speech. It's pretty unrealistic but it's good to test your listening comprehension. 圧倒的棒読み I need to play it x0.75 to listen it LOL The translations are not rly correct most of the time. For actually learning the Japanese words being used, this is a disaster. "Desu kara =/= It's to bad" 
In 4:16: "It would be better if the new and the old printer are not close to each other." But the translation says "Okay, then, I think we should put it on the other side of the room." --- That's not what she said. Why won't you give the correct translation? Its good for listening practice, but its bullshit if you wanna study the actual Japanese being used by using the given translations. Sentence mining is impossible. アッドがちょっと I think we can all agree that this is definitely not beginner level. I'm Japanese.
We don't say "That's too expensive（たかすぎますね）" to staff. I'm learning at N5, the speed is okey but I see some gramma forms (and words too) not being in my course @@ any one can tell me listening in N5 test is the same with this video?? 思ったよりはやいんだね読むスピード My expectation of beginner is like... preschool 😅 Cry. Not to brag, but been watching anime in eng sub since the 5th grade and nailed every question, guess I can now safely take a trip to Japan :) It sounds like the man has no feeling😮 このオッサン10万が高いって🥺 4th month into japanese and although i didn't understand everything 50% was fine with me. The journey isn't over. I am pretty happy with my progress! I have only studied for 2 months but I managed to get all the answers. Though my vocab is lacking, I didn't really get the whole conversations just bits and pieces but enough to clearly know what was happening. I know real speech is less clear and a lot faster but I am satisfied with my progress! I am between levels N5 and N4 and I can understand almost everything. Just small details trip me off and then I dont get the answers right, haha. I need to practise more to catch those! He bought the 1st neckles without asking for the price ... I have about 1.25 years of Japanese at this point. This is almost at my level, but some of it is too challenging. I think Intermediate Level 1 would be a better classification. It is very helpful, though! Thank you so much. I almost cried when I completely understood the first one :') all of my studying has payed off TOT i understood it at all i am so baddass Finally! After all this time, I got them all right! Huuray ! So close but still not fully understanding yet💪 This is quite slow for me tho. But I think we must know the vocabularies first. This is good Is there a listening comprehesion for the 'utterly hopeless beginner'? 例文がゴミ🤪 3:25 They're agreeing to put the printer next to the window, but there's still a red X? 
15:38 "I will stay there for two nights" but the plane only moves from Tuesday to Wednesday during that line, and doesn't move to Thursday until the next line. So happy when you can understand Japanese only through anime So nice Okay I always thought I was at the early intermediate stage so I was ashamed when I listened to this and could only get about half of it. I'm glad after reading the comments that I'm not the only one who found this above beginner levelArigatou Gozaimas  nihonggo more benkyou shitai node ato wa kakitai des yokatta kono video mite  benkyou narimashita 🙏👏👏👏 Thank you i believe after Some Time lets hmm... 3 YEARS I will know Japanese A loott better Lesson 2 please🙄😳 Finally Got a good Channel.

Your teaching is really good thank you💞 Answer to the mystery of “KI” 
Back in the days people used ink and brushes to write, so the “KI” would be written like き or separately depending on how much ink u have left.
Both are correct and same “ki”. However it depends on the font style. To avoid further confusion, for textbooks they use the separate “ki”version. For Mincho or Gothic font its the together “ki” Thanks a lot your one hell of a help sensei hoping to master the language soon with your help Ando aquí  xd Good days, my friend, thank you for shearing... we hope that the communication between us will continue with joy and pleasure Arigatho dojaimasht (thank you) Thank you so much teacher . l hope to learn japanes language a day and come to japan for visiting peoples cultures beautiyfuly of japan and so so very soon . ✌🙏look out yourself with corona now please . 😷💌💕shaban arji 50 year maread from tehran iran 良い come from China， good Are you give online classes only? how can i learn japanese online other than youtube？ Hiragana to katakana dekimashita.

I'm a truly beginner in Japanese, you've a clear pronunciation, that's help a lot.
I'm late but, sorry, I've just one issue with the translation on 19:22,19:54, 20:12, 20:30 : I wonder if is there a typo ?
You said 'はつおんして' (発音して), it's was a unknown する-verb for me, Google translation give this 'pronounce it') or the translation script has the verb 'read'. I've checked kanji once more with nihongoDera furigana maker and analyzer.
I hope i'm correct.

Shouldn't it be 食べ instead of just 食？
Like 食べます. まじか？笑 This teaches absolutely nothing. Wtf Not useful doesn’t show how to pronounce a little tip for yall. Write everything down when you dont know what it means or when you need to learn it the most Sounds like street fight v music. This video helped me work towards my n5. Arigato gozaimasu. How do you pronounce the kanji at 2:15 " 校 " ? Also in which context is this word being used? Could you use it in a sentence please? Thank you so much!! i am learning kanji for the first time Been studying Japanese on Duolingo for about a year. I could read about 80%. Looks like i need to do more studying. I want to at least attempt the N5 The ending Niku(meat) make me cry😢😢 😂😂 I learnt to write korean in a day.. learning Japanese will take me ages ,. Eh? I knew almost half of them already 😍😍 猪八大系 Who is seeing comments if it works or not It would be helpful to add furigana too 日文翻譯? I was surprised by how many of these I knew! 私-わたしwatashi 
語-ごgo Me being happy bc I know 58 kanji Doesn't help if how each are pronounced, you just show us the Kanji and the English translation without the On Yomi and Kun Yomi. Who's learning because they love anime 2:05 
月 doesn't thsi mean moon? In the video it's month.
Why?? Me : Try to learn japanese
Also me : Subconsciously pronounce words in chinese😂 My time stamp 2:16 Me: looks easy enough idk why people are saying it’s tough
Me writing: oh ok it’s harder than it looks 감사합니다 Hmm...well i think it's Chinese characters.. passed the winter of '19 N5. haven't practiced much this year. Happily still testing at the N5 level! Plz anyone write my name in Japanese, Shaharyar Please write on yo mi and kun yo mi along with these Save I’m perfect. Yeah it’s kinda way.
Wait a minute 





I am Japanese lol Is this, the whole alphabet in kanji?.ty Now kanji N4 in 5 minutes Boss battle baby Me as a native Chinese speaker using my hand to block the english meaning and trying to guess the english meaning of these japanese kanji throughout the video 👁👄👁 So i guessed nearly all of them correctly.. There were a few characters here and there where theres subtle differences in meaning between Chinese and Japanese though. Also I have tried to learn Japanese before so that help. is there a version of this where they don't show the answers? :P kinda counterproductive  if you're testing memory retention. White text on Yellow background? 🤪
Muzukashi da yo ... I need to fill my test paper its full of kanji you helped me a million thanks 🙏 NExt time: learn the basic 10000 kanji in 10 min ...
hahahah Bruh i entered the video just to see how many they are ! I recognized all but 5 ! I have been studying Japanese for only 3 months Where is un and kun readings The sad story is that they are the easiest to learn How is that learning kanji, if there is not even How tou spell it, and most kanji have wrong meanings like　分, it means minute, but in the video says understand, but understand is 分かる and not just 分. Wow! 
Moira 
From England. At least you learn something new every time so that you're prepared すごい It'll better if u added onyomi and kunyomi i put this on 2x so i can learn in two minutes This video should be named "discover L5 Kanji in 4 minutes" instead.  I mean I shouldn't really complain for free educational stuff but man it's a waste of a video if there's no added Hiragana for every Kanji. Even Romaji would be something... I mean sure, top comment writes down Hiragana but it's unedited and seems to have some mistakes so learning from that isn't best either. Piece of cake,
I will just watch this video 200 times to memorise it.
Who said learning kanji was hard. Uhmm I wanna ask something if how many kanji in N5? I saw there's 80 and then there's 100 and now 91.... 🤯 i know a lot of these from chinese characters ^^ idk how to pronounce them tho I got 79 correct 😊😊 Isn’t this all Chinese? :D मैंने सभी कांजी नोट कर लिया। लिखना काफ़ी कठिन है। कोई मदद कर सकता है क्या? Wow I have already learned  this much of kanji... great I did it in 3 days. :D this is actually really helpful because I was lost. Great experience but it will not teach anyone jlpt n5 kanji in just 4 min 8 らいん 3:18 No romaji bro. Well I knew all of them! 何です あろがとう おげんきですか Next clip: learn Heisig Kanji book in 1 hour. Lol come from n1 vid.  I thought n1 was the easiest. Im supposed to begin with freaking n5. Please write their pronunciation also ( in English,hiragana or katakana) That was FUN ! Kangi is good,,,,, but bad thing is ,,,,,,there is no Pronounce mening of these characters,,,,,,, What the heck! How am I supposed to read them?? 👍 Fortunately I know these all best game ever サンキュー あの うえ かんじ ぜんぶで いくら？ How much all of this kanji?

I just want to cry ༼;´༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ༽ C( ＾∀＾)』 After learning 600 kanji from RTK, i could recall all except 31 of them. Proud moment!To all Japanese learners, don't forget to download your Free JLPT N5 Cheat Sheet including the 103 Kanji you must know, vocabulary, grammar and more: https://goo.gl/TsTIjz 🎓 An *excellent* educational video!🎓
Unfortunately there are also some *embarrassing* and *very trivial* comments...
Well, i think the comments from these people are reflecting on their *embarrassingly* *low level* of learning... *If* these people are even at a level where you can speak of real learning...
However, i doubt that *extremely strongly* She’s cute and looks like a good person, the best combination If you were starving. i would hope my spirit could send someone in my place for you. That is to say Risa DONT LEAVE! EVEN IF YOU QUITE THIS JOB JUST STAY AROUND FOR ME I WANT TO COME FOR YOU ONE DAY. HOPEFULLY  JUST FOR LUNCH OR SOMETHING WHO KNOWS. don't give up ! going to sleep now... i hope to hear you in my dream. Risa is so cute 先生が美人ですね。🥰 I don't really think 健康保険証 is quite beginner level 😥, great video though မသာ မသာသာ နဲ့ Am I the only one who is here recently? Indian viewers please check sensei -the jaanese school seems like you dont even know the words and are just thinking on the spot.  kind of disappointing this video to get started? then you use an example  to start??????? is it the same or what? not very clear The sunlight in spring is snug???????????????? WTF does that mean???? Boy I wonder how I can work the international space station into a conversation. What a Lovely Sensei 15:20 why you do this to me.
I'm dead 19:29 Just according to cake Hate and Beautiful / clean are awfully close sounding to each other. I have a feeling this is going to come back and haunt me in the future. I found the best teacher  in Risa Risa Podcast = )

I realized @ 11:04 the hashiridase lyric is from the Yamada Taro opening theme :) (song= happiness by arashi) Cute mam You look classy with your hair like this 😻 I was hoping to meet teacher Risa, arigao for this video. Ja mata.😃😃 This is better than porn. Sugoi! If you can understand Japanese a little this is hilarious xD HOLY MOLY TURN RIGHT IN JAPANESE IS HELLA LONG XD she's one cute asian <3 Ay, Risa, eres lo más bonito del mundo, aunque cuando escucho tu nombre no puedo evitar sonreírme. atatakai is in the video twice. Also, International SPacestation is certainly not a word id think to use in my very basic japanese lol Suteki~ Risa is sexy MUITO LINDAAAAAAAAAA she's so cute but why does she look so confused every time she looks at the back of the card to find the definition? LOL she speaks Japanese. パックマンはワクワク。 So thats what pikachu is saying and what pikachu means 

Pika pika xd I'm not here yet. I'm still Duolingo level. Well, at least I hajimaru. You are not pronouncing the vocabulary very clearly , its hard to understand. You should spell the words in english in subtitles and also give the written meaning in subtitles. Its not very clear, this lesson is hard to understand. How can you ignore this fact. As she starts sings bruno mars lol arigato gozaimasu risa san! **feels unmotivated**
**watches a Risa video**
**goes back to another 8 hours of learning**
I literally have 2 months and 27 days to learn 10 years worth of Japanese education, without any formal support.... help ._.

Otherwise I can't get into a subject I want to.... Why is French literally the only ever-present language?? It's about three times the distance that Japan is - Australia, please get good ._. I hit "don't like" cuz why in the world would be the name of planets among beginner level words??? and not only planets, other strange words too Am I the only one thinking it's too fast ? It kinda confuses me Is きらきら similar with ピカピカ？
how to differentiates いくら（how much?) with イクラ(the fish egg)?

Just realized that Risa-sensei changes cloth for 11 times. Was pausing and playing the video a second time(a few times to be exact) in order to read the ひらがな when I realizes that. I still can't read ひらがな or カタカナ fast enough. I really enjoyed this video gave me some new Japanese words to learnありがとうございます I can only remember ピカピカ because if Pikachu from Pokemon Love her cute humor xD All this time pikachu has been saying "shiny" ?? Pika Pika? I couldn't hear a word she said! I would like these flash cards .... You are so pretty!  And a good Japanese teacher 👍🏼 Im in love わたし は りさ さん が だきすき です ありがとうございました How do you say 🤔 "Risa will you marry me?" 👰🤵 😍😍😍 Its very good but you go very fast  and not everyone knows kanji yet... Ohayo gozaimas .
Konnichiwa risa san 
Hontoni anata wa sugoi sugoi kawai des. ありがとございます I love Japan Ela é tão fofinha can you guys leave the subtitles a little longer after she talks? i need time to read it soemtimes i dont even have time to pause it before the subtitle dissapearsLearn Japanese with me -> https://bit.ly/3a6HeCl Thank you for the im just starting learning Japanese as soon as possible at age 12 this kind of language Litrally me using learning japanese as a excuse to watch anime Wow your voice 😍😮😍😯😍 explains how to learn Japanese speaking English but says bye bye in Italian
wtf Wheres the particles? Taberareta
Or tabesaserareta
Its hard to pronounce fast :/ Wow thank you I can speak Japanese now, within just 13 minutes 😳 i speak japanese more or less. ive studied through taking classes which was frustrating but i think it does help in a sense. i cant pass jlpt tests. my target N2. I last went to an intensive school with very unpleasant teachers. I am from US and all the other students were Asian so kanji was painful. So after I escaped from that hellish school I went crazy studying kanji like 3-5 hours everyday. I actually wrote out the kanji by hand because I dont feel like I really learn them unless I do. Now Im wondering if I should go back and use textbooks to learn for the jlpt and keigo stuff. I lived in Japan for many years and got really drunk with Japanese people all the time. So Im thinking maybe I should go back and learn all the small details and stuff from textbooks even though its mostly just for JLPT and not actually useful in real life. 4:11 I feel attacked Yuta-san 😂😂😂😂😂 5:51 me when I  learning Japanese, and I forget all I learn. This video is amazing, thank you Yuta sensei I already speak Spanish and the pronunciation of  a,i,u,e,o as you may already know is similar if not the same to that of Spanish Confidence is great, but self-awareness is also important. ©
 - Yuta I love how japanese people say you your japanese sucks: Your japanese is good. im learning japanese for 1 year and i cant speak but i can understand. so harddd English is actually my second language. Does that mean japanese might be easier to learn than most people? i thought everything was easy until after i mastered hiragana and katakana i realized one kanji could have up to 12 different readings. ありがとうゆた先生！I love your videos so much and they’re really helpful as someone learning Japanese! 💕 wait is this free? For some reason in all the languages I've studied Japanese seems to have the most learners "correcting" people incorrectly. 7:28 I only watch anime for research purposes what book is that in the thumbnail? I just wanna learn Japanese because I envy Japanese speakers. 🥺🥺🥺. Also I don't wanna read subtitles anymore. xD when I say nihongo jouzu desu ne It's like yuyuuho grammar You had me at Oregairu! That's exactly how I learned English by whatching animes and movies without subtitles in my own language....but now I regretted why didn't I whatched Japanese dub instead😂😅😅 Being slavic is kinda cheaty to learn Japanese pronounciation how do i use stickers in real life 4:00

Dammit boys, fall back we've been spotted







(That and to visit Japan one day, bonus perk is talking to my friend who is also learning japanese next to my parents or my other friends who dont speak it XD) *Learning with Minna no Nihongo*
Video thumbnail: No
Me: *Well, fuck.* Idk why but I love the japanese grammar so much I just want to tell friends how it works Do you have any books you would recommend for a Japanese beginner reader? It’s really hard trying to find books that aren’t too advanced for me. I don’t mind if it’s manga, or children’s novels this channel suck lol more like that spam man I just want to watch anime without subtitles 🖤 Spanish and Japanese have the same accent, I speak Spanish so Pronunciation is a little easier for me 5:52 , dont click That suggestion about watching Japanese shows or media with Japanese captions has actually helped me A LOT (although I just do it with music) , I can almost instantly recognize most if not all hiragana and katakana and a good amount of kanji Is it important to learn writing hiragana and kanji initially? WHY ENGLISH PEOPLE WHYY Jesus christ where have u been all my life ?! This is entertaining + informative + fast .. my guy u are a 10/10 thanks for this !!! 9:41 
Well I guess I, an 11 year old, can't watch anime without it being subbed or dubbed I learned that “yakusoku/ 約束/ やくそく” means “promise” from the promised neverland is it free?? This guy is a clown. He says Minna No Nihongo but that book is one of the best textbooks for Japanese written by native speaker PhDs who actually know what they are talking about. Watch my video for proper methods of learning Japanese. https://youtu.be/U_eQll3HD64 If only i could learn japanese as quick as the transfer students in anime The most important thing in learning a language is don't be afraid of mistakes. Just use it, preferrably, speak it. The pronunciation for me is a bit easy, cause I can already speak  HINDI (India) and alphabet pronunciation in Japanese is similar to hindi. Use Wanikani and once you get to level 10 start learning grammar Solid advice. Felt like a Japanese spin on this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiTsduRreug Could you recommend some Japanese books for self-study please? I am an absolute beginner. I want to study by myself without a tutor. I don't know which books to buy. Pronunciation wise I think I'll be alright. I already know Spanish and I heard phonetically they're really close, despite being really different languages. And for those who study both: at least in Spanish, vowles are exact. If that's true in Japanese, that's way easier than you think to get down, you just have to not filter it through English. Also in Spanish, stress vowels are very important and can even change the meaning of the word, but to my ear (again, I don't know Japanese), Japanese people don't seem to put stress on vowels. They all seem exact. But that could also be my inexperience with the language, so if anyone wants to chime in, I'm all ears. You sir! Earned yourself a subscriber This man knows English grammar better than me Esto puede aplicar a casi todo los idioma 🌻 me seeing Kyubey plushy on the table: ahhhh so that’s how One question if we learn Japanese will the kanji  Chinese kanji still sound the same :3 Does kanji have a system as to how it works? (Like, if it is multiple other characters combined in some way) Or do you have to just brute force memorize them all? When native English speakers annoy the hell out of Yuta 5:51 🤣🤣🤣 4:09 I have been called out I just got my first japanese lession on gmail. I can't wait to start learning! anata no nihongo wa yoi desu 
Is this correct and can I say it as an alternative for -
Nihongo jouzo desu ne
I mean which one can I use without been thinking a fool I want to learn to read and write and i got hiragana more or less down and katakana is a work in progress but kanji is horrific. Also you say how real Japanese talk, is this purely casual or is けいご included? fax] Everybody thinks that I am a weeb because I am learning Japanese. English and Japanese are probably the hardest everyday languages to learn. Especially is you only known english your whole life and are learning japanese for your first new language. And vice versa native speaker teaching someone how to speak their language doesn't make sense to me, learning when you're a baby and learning when you're adult are completely diffrent HOLY SHIT I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY BARON TAMAGO FROM ONE PIECE WAS CALLED BARON TAMAGO! HE’S AN EGG! 問う everyone forgets about this irregular verb complaining about 200 verbs you have to memorize, meanwhile thousands upon thousands of kanji... at least its fun to draw them T-T 日本語が難しいだよがんばって！ How do you say I want that Kyubei plushie in japanese Imagine telling your crush she's scary by accident. 日本語が難しくねぇなあああああぁぁ(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵) I don't get it, Chinese have tones, Japanese doesn't, but also pitch patterns are kinda like tones, because different words may have the same kana but different pitches anyway. But we don't have to learn it???????? Why do people say Japanese don't have tones?? I just wanna watch sub without the subtitles As an English speaker, I can confirm that are language is dumb I want those stickers XD Some of them I don't get though, the pictures don't seem to fit with the phrase.

またあとでね！Just looks like he's quickly leaving.
元気？Is he supposed to be living in a sewer and this is supposed to be ironic ?
すばらしい！I can't even guess how the picture is related to this one.
 
The rest are great XD You rock! If I can put 1000 hours into apex legends I can put 1000 to learn Japanese as well 😎 5:51 I CAN'T 😂😂😂😂😂 when you see the textbook you learn from in university on the thumbnail- you know you gotta click 已接受挑战。

先生。 5:52 HAHAHAHAHA Three months ago i had the crazy ambition to go work in Japan as a 3D artist. To do so i need at least N2 lvl in japanese, so i decided to join the language academy of Montreal's university..... The only problem is ... i already speak 3 languages (Spanish, English and french) so this is getting kind of crazy!!!!!  It is, at the same time,  ,subarashii and muzukashii! hahahaha 05:52 when i go to US and the McD doesn't provide rice in their menu 6:52
me I completely understand the kawaii/kowaii situation.  I was in a 7-11 when my Japanese was limited to Gairaigo into English such as sushi and tempura. While in the store I wanted to eat something but I couldn't think of any food names in Japanese except daifuku (mochi with sweet pastes inside). For some reason I wasn't saying it right. So I decided to describe it.

Remembering it had anko inside I said "中にうんこがあります" to which she replied "no, no it doesn't, or at least if it does we don't sell it here". The Japanese readers amung you will know I actually said "it has poop inside". 

So I further embarrassed myself with "赤くて暖かくていつもねばねばしている" (it's red, and warm and usually sticky". 

She later explained to me that unko means 💩 and we had a laugh and a joke. But moral of the story is confidence is sometimes be t a food thing with languages lol. *0:51** Utsukushii Oregairu stickers* I'm from Canada. The pronunciation of Japanese sounds is mostly very straight forward to me. I guess it's because in general Canadians are "clear speakers" of English. Not my term, someone from the UK said that to me one. A and O sound very different to me and are easy to differentiate. The pronunciations I struggle with are the R column, らりるれろ. I grew up learning French in school (since it's an official second language of Canada). There I learned very hard Rs. I can roll an R like nobody's business like those who speak romance languages can... but the combination of R & L sounds are VERY hard for me. I'm still only 8 days into learning Japanese though, so time will tell if I can master the sound. I want to start learning japanese where do i start 😩 duolingo time. I understand your point about children vs adult language learning, but we know children learn a language naturally, where adults have to really sit down and learn it. This is why we refer to the critical window period. I do understand your point though. Lol actually Japanese grammar is kinda difficult for English ppls but if any  anyone from south Asia reading this then remember Japanese grammar is similar to our mother tongue so don't panic
Only the kanji is going to beat the shit out of you  😅😂 I’d have to learn a lot because I want to move to Japan for a career in music and songwriting is going to have a lot Yuta: "1000 hours seem like a lot right?"
Me: **Looks at 3800 hours of Skyrim played on Steam** 
"Well, yes but no..." The 'Nihongo jouzu desu ne!' bit made me cackle, especially after watching the Trash Taste podcast with Calli I just watch Filthy Frank.

sino pa pumunta dito para sa anime? Thank you po I started my interest in learning japanese when I heard the phrase "Yamete Kudasai" 😁 First I have to learn Filipino😂😂 very helpful :) Hello po. San po kayo nagapply as teacher? 😍😍😍 Arigatoooo! I want to learn japanese language Watch anime same like me 😂😂 Example pss I am amazed by you. You are good at japanese language. Are u teaching at public school or private?!thank you. Nagaaral po ako ng japenese pero po Yung speak ko hindi po malinawI want somehow this in pdf we have this same ね in portuguese too.. same pronunciation, place and meaning, but writen as "né", like an abbreviation of "não é?" ^^ 日本語を教え始めました。すごく勉強になりました！ありがとうございます。 Ten month later I came back to this video. Just to brush up. 😁 Спасибо вам за уроки учитель! When you start learning japanese with hiragana, you're pretty happy to be able to read each symbol and then you check any japanese content and half of the text is katakana xD
RIP I'm just here for anime This is awesome and so clear, thank you! Thank you for these videos. I'm teaching myself Japanese and you are one of my favorite creators to watch to help me learn. Keep up the great work. ありがとございます。またね。 ありがとうございます、私日本語は愛する。❤🌸 I found it easier to learn katakana first, because the shapes are more simple, and katakana is used specifically for foreign/borrowed words so once you learn the chart, you can read right away!! It motivated and excited me to learn even more! 
I used an app called Robokana, highly recommend!! Other apps I’ve been using: duolingo, kanadrill, drops, Eggbun, LingoDeer, bunpo. I’ve tried a few more but these ones helped each in their own way. If you use duolingo, make sure to read the lesson tips and comments! Duo only has so much explanation so make sure to check other sources. ☺️ 23:43 it lasted so long even in 1.75 speed 発音がとても上手いですね！ What is the informal forms of る verbs? You are amazing , truly You speak English so well. I am so impressed! Thank you. Thank you so much 4 the lesson iku you!! ugh i’m so glad I found your channel you are so good at explaining the things that confuse me im still confused about something. how do you determine which of the sounds (a, i, u, e, o) to switch the word to? like are there any requirements for each or different uses for them? Misa: Do not use "Shine," it means Die in a rude form... Me: *Thinking on say it to my best friend* Another motivation fact: somebody has to learn english to watch such a high-quality video about Japanese (hi ._.) Since I speak Spanish, the respect for things might help me understand Japanese better!
When asking how someone is in Spanish, we say
“¿Como estas?”
Or
“¿Cómo estás tu?”
But when speaking to elderly or trying to be respectful we will say,
“¿Cómo está *usted* ?” not really ultimate, but I understand what are you trying to imply. Ashiteru Wanna speak it well 28:28 I heard the Overwatch Reference, I hit like. hahahaha.
Enjoyed the lessons though, thnx so much Misa sensei, I'll watch you later today - I teach Science today. You're probably the best online sensei! Were I in Japan, I would like to take Japanese lessons from you. Your video is very informative. I’m currently learning Japanese but the conjugation has always been difficult for me. I’ll be back in a year to update y’all on how much I improved. Please keep it up. I actually watched the whole video. Much appreciated. 👍🙏 English speakers read 'you' as 'yu'
Japanese speakers read 'you' as 'yo'
Meanwhile, we Indonesians :


'you' = 'y-o-u' that video is so useful I am dedicated to learn A I U E O form jutsu, next I will go for TE form jutsu. This was so helpful!! I had the hardest time trying to figure out why the end of the word changes when it's put in a sentence. Thank you for the video! Japanese reminds me of my native tongue , the pronouncing of words,  we also use ne I recently started learning Japanese. Your guide through these complicated matters has helped me so much I can't even describe it in the words. Thank you so much for what you are doing, I really appreciate it. Please don't stop! ❤😊❤ I have confusion about this thing quite a while. This video really give clear idea to me. Thank you very much 👍. First thing I’m gonna do when I get to Japan, “Oi, omae… Shine” 👺 This video is incredibly helpful. Thank you so much! 先生は言語がいくつしていますか。 どうもありがとうございます! Lol.  You can tell she thinks she’s so cute when she says “nan desu ka “ 18:31 You make the language seem more accessible, i'll make sure to watch all your classes! すごい！
ありがとうございます^ - ^
あなたはかわいいです。 ahhh so helpful thanks :) at first i was confused by this video, so if anyone that just started watching this is too, just watch it a second time and you will get it. this is such a good explanation! Conjugación de verbos: 

あ= negativoない, tener queなきゃ, Pasado negativo なかった

い= Formaます, Quieroたい

う= presente y futuro 

え= Imperativo rudo (Tipo う)
お= Imperativo rudo (Tipo る)

て= Forma de Petición (para los dos) 

おう= Vamos a... (Tipo う)
よう= Vamos a... (Tipo る) Omg thank you misa 😭 the last message was really important awwww. I’m from Spain so English is not even my first language but I understand you soo well, thank you for all the work ∩^ω^∩ I'm lost I tho it was tabemasu, nomimasu, kakimasu, kaeremasu... Thak you so much for your videos. They are amazing and very helpful. That’s the most helpful video 
Oh thank you for this video 
Love u Well explained and thank you for the peptalk at the end too, needed that I should have been born Japanese. Welsh but so much in common.😊 so how's Light and Shinigami? :) omg its s o nice. thank you<3 This video helps me a lot! I´ve been looking for a video like this for days! 
Studying japanese by yourself can be hard sometimes, but you made it easy! Thanks for that! GOSSH U EXPLAIN SO WELL I knew this but it was good to go over it again. Misa, it would be really nice to have some homework for us to do with this :) I would pay for this of course. I have to say, you are one among few youtubers where I feel captivated and really pay attention to what you're saying. I always get several "aha" moments when I listen to you. Thank you Misa! This video is better than anything else on YouTube. Thank you very much! 13:48 "when i learned russian" bruh she knows russian too???? sheesh every time she says something in Japanese i just have a cuteness heart attack LMAO I loved your lesson! Thank you so much! Is wo sounded like oh? Кто ещё кротика на заднем фоне заметил?  . . . ありがとうございます！ Sukses terus mba.... Salam 👍 In “あついね” is it grammatically correct to use “あついだね” or does that sound wrong to native speakers? 14:30 YOOOOO SHE SAID POOP XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Thank you very much Japanese Ammo's Misa The words of encouragement and appreciation for those who are trying to learn Japanese is just amazing 💕 10:58 is it a coincidence that these exception -u verbs. all have their i/e sound in the kanji rather than in hiragana e.g 帰(か『え』)る　食『べ』る

いつも便利なビデオ作ってくれて、みさ先生にありがとう。 wow, I can see how much of a negative connotation the 'e' conjugation is while you're explaining it. definetly won't say that unless i know someone really well A good way of remembering Verb/Adjective conjugation pattern in general is to connect it(the particular conjugation pattern)to a tree.
Why a tree you might ask,well because every conjugation thus far has a specific branch(again the tree metaphor I was going for) of conjugations, ~ます,ません、ました、ませんでした。and so on.again I am only trying to help you…so thank you for reading That おう/よう Conjugation pattern,A easy way to remember it would be this:I will not be Willing/capable of doing the action without YOU(you being the important part here.  I wanted to help the person in trouble with that in particular so thank you for reading. Your background is so cute btw, I love all the Pokemon plushies and Pokemon stuff! Thank you so much for this! The verb conjugations aren't difficult but it can be hard to keep them all stright in your head, like which ones to use for which verbs, ect. So this is a really helpful guide to be able to reference and go back to, thank you so much! I also didn't know that about the 'E-ending' rude form, thank you for warning us about that lol. I’m so mad lol I wish I found such beautifully made content for learning mandarin on YouTube 😩🥰 This is the most detailed and cleat tutorial I have learned. I love your videos and u! 3:05 I have a question about the wo.. it sounds like youre saying yo.  Is that how I will always here it pronounced? O my god I’m completely in love. Are you married? 

Just kidding. Thanks for explanation.
Keep doing.☺️ Can I know that we can also use Hiragana font instead Kanji for that have own pronunciation? how about if you want to say let's eat lunch more formally? for example your saying to to your upperclassmen,
昼ごはん食べます is this correct? I think your such a lovely teacher arigatō ❤️ Easy, so easy. I just can't express my gratitude to you sensei. This gave me so much motivation to keep continuing learning such a beautiful language. I also love your message at the end which encouraged me to learn more. Arigato gozaimasu sensei! <333 I just finished the video I learned so much thanks . Trying to pass the n5 exam! Kanji is the easier part and verbs is where I start to struggle! I love your videos misa! Ну раз уж ты знаешь русский. Спасибо большое за урок, ты прекрасна! this helps a lot, thank youuuu Wow ! This is very informative. Thank you so much. . Keep doing what you’re doing its very helpful. Love that accent too. anyone can reccomend me a good app to learn japanese verbs im desperate plz たすかりますー This is my first time on your channel and I was bit hesitant to watch this video because of how long it is, but as soon as I pressed play I took my notebook and the whole video I kept writing notes. This video is amazing and so informative! It actually makes so much sense now. I can't thank you enough for explaining all this I learned masu and desu first and now I'm trying to understand informal Japanese 🙄 13:35 hiragana is what I'm learning right now, trying to get down katakana, and suffering brain damage from kanji. Loved the last part, it really motivated me to keep studying japanese. Finally understood what Iori said in his super move 八稚女 which is 死ね in the game The King of Fighters. Lol She is a good teacher Tanoshikatta 🤗👍🏻Ma ta hereko herei vayexo haseko hasei panni Dai yo video ta 10 min ko xa ni ta 🙄😂 Thank you sir https://youtu.be/9dPGekA5prM Hahahaha लेख्ने स्टाइल सिकाको चाई सरै रमाइलो लाग्यो। Dhangadhi bata ho sir Vhakkar 17 yrs lage tarw pani malai japanese language siknw dherei manxa rw yo video harerw sajilo sangw bujaunu vako xa hjr lai Tq ☺️ Kati majja le sikaunu vako k😊💕 Adhi adhi gardine Sabai alphabet haru Serial sikaunuhos na sir Khai ta aarko part hjr Comedy master 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Thankyou sir arigato sir Ma kuwait bata hereko dai hjr le ekdam ramro bujhaunu vo Tara Japanese language ko lagi kati class padheko hunu parxa Thank you for video ....i am from dharan nepal Surkhet Watching form ktm thank you thank you any naruto watcher😉🤘 Jatilaka0anlsakana かんたん日本語の勉強教えて　あげた買ったんだけど　この　ビデオ送って　しかた　が　わかるようになりました Good language てゃんｋ よｙ 先生 Mobile bta watching form Butwal   thank you sansei Thanks for helpful vedio sir! 😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍 Hajimasiti = Nameste
