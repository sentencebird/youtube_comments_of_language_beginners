Keep up the good work dear. Tesekkürler ogretmen Tesekkürler 📍❗️Get saved now: Do you know when your going to die? Will you go to Heaven when you die? Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent (turn away from sin) and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you. Hi, I'm samir.

Link: https://youtu.be/orklaWSJ51A Me gusta mucho el idioma pero lo encuentro realmente dificil para mi con una mentalidad latina. Gracias bir yerdrn baslamamiz gerek Love from Armenia 🇦🇲🇦🇿🇹🇷 Abi vallaha maşallah ingilizcen çok iyi. Bende almanyada doğdum ve orda yaşıyorum ve benim de ingilizcem çok iyi. Senin gibi iyi ingilizce konuşabilen türkleri çok nadir görüyorum. Ya tanıdığım türkler ingilizce konuşamıyor ya da türkçeyi konuşamıyorlar Nice, i see contaminations between turkish and russian Clear and easy to follow explanation! I was abt to give up learning the language and saw ur video today! Pls keep on making more Turkish lessons! Filipina living in London! ♥️ Abi ingilizce öğrenme videolarına gel bir tane İngiliz yok ama Türkçe öğrenme videolarına gel sadece Türk var biz Türkler niye böyleyiz ya Video harika, çok güzel ayrıntılar da vermişsiniz, tebrikler! me being distracted by his voice checkkkkk Farklı bir ülkede yaşamış biri olarak Türkçeniz gayet güzel. Ayrıca Türkçe ile verdiğiniz bilgilerden dolayı da tebrik ederim. Çünkü ülkemizdeki birçok insan alfabemiz değişince dilimizin de değiştiğini sanıyor. Hi, I'm samir. I am learning English. Can you help me speak English with me? I can also help you learn Turkish language 📚🙂 Ich dachte du würdest auf Deutsch sprechen und dann kommst du mit perfektem Englisch? Haha danke für die Infos, echt cooler Kanal Yo aquí sin entender nada 😐 Hafiza comes from the Arabic and it means "to keep in mind". កុំអោយអាញប្រើខួរក្បាល   បន្តទៀត   អាញទុកខួរទំនេចោលវាមិនឈឺ   ហើយក៍។វាមិនហត់ផង   ? How do you say kebab in Arabic? Who come here after done watching few Turkish drama series like me? Now my weekend never feel bore anymore. Thanks for this lesson. I really liked your explanation besides a clear voice, the pace when you are explaining is also great. My native language is Portuguese and I confess Turkish seems to be chanllenging. I will watch the other videos of yours before jumping to conclusions. Thanks. Merhaba Jilet is razor in Turkish and it’s also how we pronounce Gillette here and it’s the biggest razor brand on the market. How cool is that ? You look like Furkan Andic Somee??? Words?🤪😂 sooooo Many words are the exact same word as the Persian language just saying 🤪❤️ @5:56 "most European languages have a strict word order" - BULLSSHIT.  Most European languages have a free word order. It is only the Romance and most Germanic languages that are limited to a fied word order.  But that is NOT all Europe.  Slavic languages have free word order and pretty much all the others too. I just subscribed çok teşekkür ederim for the great content😁 No grammatical gender?? THAT's TERRIBLE!  Words feel so empty, so devoid of personality!
Also, it sucks that you can't even indicate with your pronoun ("O") whether it's a person (he/she) or a thing (it). That's such an important distinction. I am kazakh and I learn Turkish language. Turkçe kazakça ile biraz benzer Basically it’s very similar to Russian :D Marhaba, ben ekmek yerim lol
P/s: I'm just new to this language, so be easy with me You are so cool.. plus your voice is amazing. You sound so good man .. ❤️❤️ I came here cause I want to learn Turkish so badly! Lol it sounds soooo amazing! This video was really informative and just amazing! Thank you for creating it 💯🌹❤️🙂 I did not understand how ö and ü differ from each other if they make the same sound 😅 I am romanian and I never knew that romanian has that many sounds in common with turkish, for example the ș, r, ç, I sounds. I guess it s because of the Ottomans who ruled over us for 400 years.  :)))) they really had an influence on our food and now I find that on the language as well, very interesting I'm arapic naitev spekers and i think it's too essy to learn But word order changes are not random. Each change changes emphasis. So much so that it sometimes changes the meaning from simple stating of a fact to confrontation, to defending yourself or someone else to bragging.... Depends. 
Word order matters.
Redundant words are omitted.
(Word order change may change some agglutination s) I am a Persian person and i must say i always fascinated by Turkish and after this i got a little more  enthusiastic. And btw u r a great tutor and best of luck. plz teach us more and god bless u Mustafa Kemal switched to Latin and the literacy rate skyrocketed 🤔🤔 🤔 Where did you learn English and Spanish? Short and sweet. Thank you Yorumlara suriyeli var mi diye geldim adamlar yillardir ulkemizde yasiyor ama heriflerin Turkce ogrenmeye niyeti yok. açık ve net .teşekkürler 12:28
yabancıya anlatırken söylendiğinde gerçekten attitude kazanıyor agsdgsds Ya me hice fan de este canal, definitivamente 🙅🏻‍♀️😍 Am in love with your voice 😍😍😍 Yeni başlayanlar bu videoya tiklamamali I want to learn turkish language because I always watching turkish series 🧡
Watching here from philippines 🇵🇭 to Bahrain 🇧🇭 This helps me understand my Turkish friend so much better. I am learning and plan to visit the country in early 2022. English and Spanish are the only languages I know and similarities are sparse. Thank you for this. ilk defa full video izliyorum I'm an Indian. I simply loved your lesson because you've tried explaining most of the complicated things in Turkish. You're a linguist so you do have the advantage of comparing so many languages. I've tried learning French too, however, when it comes to watching and understanding French, the pronunciation is so different and the language so fast, like Turkish. I don't know, perhaps all European languages are spoken really fast, and it becomes difficult to learn the correct pronunciation. English I feel is a comparatively easy language. I would still try to learn both these languages. I've been an English trainer, and it's really difficult for students to learn the grammar and pronunciation of English too, and I feel the same while trying to learn a fast spoken language like French or Turkish. I must say, Turkish people are really close to North Indians in their looks. Some descent is connected. I love to watch Turkish series, and I'm happy about exploring a new country, culture and language. There are a few words common with Hindi and Urdu in Turkish, like rahat, dushman, inteqaam etc. Etymology must be somewhere in Persian I'm guessing. This was great. Cuban American who loves everything about Turkey! I would die to know, how is Turkish not hard. I am tired of Turkish ppl saying English is hard and keep complaining. If English is hard then what ab Turkish with no actual Grammer 💀 Hi, Hope you are well - I have just come across your channel as I am learning Turkish (love Turkey and the language) and you are amazing. I like the way how you explain stuff. I have learnt some expression from Turkish series. Could you please have more lessons? 🙏 Many Thanks The r in Turkish is the same as that in Italian 9:23 Sırf bu yine yanlış anlatılmış mı diye bakmaya gelmiştim yanılmamışım. ''Bağırmak'' sözcüğünü yazıldığı gibi okumak yanlış değildir. İstanbul Türkçesinde kullanılmıyor olması bu sözcüğü yanlış yapmıyor. TDK'nin internet sitesine girerseniz orada uygun söyleyişin sesli hali olacaktır. Orada da İstanbul Türkçesi ile değil yazıldığı biçimde okunuyor. Kesin olarak ''yanlış'' diye nitelendirilmesi yanlış. Great work mate! I’d recommend checking out PromoSM.! ! It will help your videos rank better in the search results!! ''Ağzına sağlık.'' or "Health be with your mouth." I love Turkish people!Wishing them the best! 🇬🇷🇹🇷 Jesteś super, szkoda, że nie znasz polskiego. Pozdrawiam Thank you so much , u helped me to understand a lot of things well some of them  cuz I have a bigger background about Turkish  since I'm Arabic it's easier for me to learn Turkish soo Yap I'm glad that I found this video keep going 💜💜 https://youtu.be/3Jr1RKR_uD0 Thank youuuuuu 🥺❤️ An approximation of the 'ı' sound in German would be the voiceless 'e' in "sagen". I’m Iraqi well I speak Arabic and learned English well my mom wants to go to turkey and start a new life but we don’t know how to talk Turkish so I will study Turkish now for her Your are an amazing teacher. I am a poliglot and I can say that Turkish is extraordinary. I love It!
Çok Teşekürler!!! The letter “ı” in Turkish is equivalent to the letter “ë” in Albanian. Just wanted to point that out. Abi yabancı arkadaşım çok sevdi öğretme stilini lütfen devam et. Good video birine "sen kimsin?" dersen kavga çıkar yalnız. doğrusu "ben reşat, ya sen?" olmalı. I'm from Uzbekistan. Uzbek language is one language of Turkic language family. And I learned Turkish by watching Turkish films. Learning Turkish was very easy for me. Because, a lot of words in my own language were similar with Turkish words. It's easy to learn Turkish for people who speaks in the Turkic languages. Não sei se fiquei mais feliz em entender o seu inglês sem legendas ou em ver o quanto o turco parece descomplicado... Texekkürler! Do you actually run a course to learn Turkish? I like your language teaching style and I am from a linguistic background and you tend to use familiar terminology Ulu önderimize deginmen guzel olmus .Al sana begeni 👍👌👍👌 I wonder if I can look at this language through an Urdu lens and find common ground and understanding of its nuances. you explain very well sir, thank you 💗 Have you thought of teaching this in Spanish? A lot of Latin american / Hispanic people like Turkish series. I speak English but it will be easier if I learn it in my native language (Spanish) Merhaba, ben Laura. I really enjoyed your wonderful video! It is very well put together. Thank you! My second language is Japanese (I am a citizen). I notice so many similarities. Similar syntax, many similar words...it is fascinating! I gave up learning turkish. The R's are killing me with them something sounding like sh. I love turkish language, I really want to learn it❤ and after this video I probably will. There are a lot of similar sounds like in lithuanian language (my native language) so I hope it won't be very hard.😅 Hafıza ❌

Ben bir arap seni seviyorum English is not phonetic and on the other side we have ALL OTHER languages. Thank you 😊 for helping me wow it was so interesting to know about these facts... Urdu is derived from different languages and one of those is 'Turkish'. So many of the words are similar in both the languages...

Is there someone who wants to learn Turkish from the native speaker, I'd like to help all of u guys. Write a comment. See you arkadaslar yksde cıkmıyor Cidden bazı arkadaşların sorguladiği gibi ben de sorgulamaya basladim.

Gorusmek uzere!!

I have learned ony this much turkish 😢 but thanks to this channel I can pronounced korean, Japanese and chineses easily but I find this one hard At verbs You speak more faster ...We are unable to understand and pronounce...This not useful Nice to meet you is hard - lots of syllables (5?) in that first word. Who else is here after watching Ressurection Ertugrul... 
Engin Altan Duzyatan is Love of life... 
In Love with Turkey... Yes, repeating is the best way to memorize but I am watching it now and again ... because of You ! Bushra session really slow and fast enjoyable teaching Nobody really uses "İyi günler" for "Good Afternoon" though. In street speech people often use it for "good day", time of day isn't represented in the sentence and can be used at all times. Good Afternoon is strictly "Tünaydın" I'd say since "after noon" refers to time stamp between noon and evening and tünaydın transliterally means "(sun)lit evening" thus refers to the same time stamp. the Turkish word "şoför" and the Hungarian word "sofőr" means the same and we almost write it the same :D I am trying to impress someone so the video comes in handy, Thank you... Merhaba 😊 from Philippines . Who else interested about Turkish culture and language after watching their movies ?❤️ Kiralik Ask brought me here 😄 Sen Cal Kapimi bring me here... 😍😍❤️ Allah San Razu I love to learn Turkish with Pakistani Background from Denmark.

X) türkçe öğrenmek gerçekten çok zordur. öğrenen insanlara saygı duyuyorum çünkü bunu başardıysa her şeyi başarabilir bu hayatta. çocukken yaşadığım şehre, sovyetler dağılınca o ülkeden çok insan geldi ve şunu söyleyebilirim, ruslar ve gürcüler çok hızlı öğreniyorlar türkçeyi. gerçekten zeki insanlar. sonradan ögrendikleri için gramer kurallarına uygun ve sadık konuşuyorlar. Iam here because of Erkenci Kus karantinanın artık saymaya unuttuğum günü: kendi dilimi öğreniyorum Çok teşekkür ederim, Selin! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭my whole family is Turkish and I don't know how to speak but I understand a little and I can't even translate to them so I'm trying to learn Turkish Selin i smile your speaking Turkish !

You see all these videos that say learn turkish in 1lesson, learn it in 25 mins and all that stuff but what most peoplr dont really realize is that without a solid foundation, you'd just find yourself back here someday struggling to learn the basics again.
I'm saying this based on my experience with english, a solid foundation is always the most important step in learning a new language. Merhaba, çok teşekkür ederim 🤩❤️ Me from Ertugral I am here after watching 6th time ask laftan anlamaz Hehe ben türküm sjsjjs ama nedense bunu izliyorum This is very good  I am Learning fast and it is so fun and great 👍🏻 👍🏻😀😁😄😃😆 l am so so happy 😁 Thanks for the lovely lessons! Perfect!! No need to change. I am obsessed with Turkey series sefirin kizi and love watching engin akyurek dramas You teach very good but the problem is you talk and show the words and phrases very fast and we can’t understand and concentrate well during the teaching I understood one thing there are lots of common words between Turkish and Urdu/Hindi... So it would be little bit easier for people knowing Hindi or Urdu language to learn Turki.. i want to learn turkish cause my dadd says inshaAllah  we will travel there Iyi ❤ Can u speak slowly when u are spelling turkish words please Ertugrul Would u believe Ertugrul ghazi brought me here Anyone here becouse thay dont know turkish and we have turkish online lesson I am here just for turkish Dramas Who is here after watching Ertugrul?

And bay yanlis 😁❤️ 3:23 Sorry ye üzgün demişsiniz. İngilizce'de birine Sorry diyebilirsiniz. Bu üzgünüm anlamına gelir Türkçede. "I'm sorry" de üzgünüm anlamına gelir. Ama Türkçe'de "üzgün" diyemezsiniz, "üzgünüm" dersiniz. 1:31 "Sabah" or *"Gündüz"*
Sabah is Persian, Gündüz is Turkish

3:38 "Teşekkür ederim/Teşekkürler" or "Sağol"(informal)/"Sağolun" (formal)
Teşekkür is Arabic, Sağol is Turkish Who is here after watching feriha?

Someone please explain, I watch Turkish series with English subs.  I am surprised when a female, a sister is called a brother or a he; also "you are welcome" is used when the Turkish dialogue seems to be a request, not a welcoming to someone's home.  Are the translations done by computer program?
Just two minor things, often the translations are extremely poor and difficult to follow. (English - Turkish) FLIGHT = UÇUŞ

Bir iş yapıyorsunuz düzgün yapın. "İyi Öğlenler" diye bir kavram YOK Türkçe'de. "İYİ GÜNLER" VAR !! Okay i don't understand why she's pronouncing " r " as " ş " in the words öğlenler , akşamlar and geceler ?? It's confusing. Please enunciate the "r" at the end that is if that's how these words are pronounced; if not then why not change their spellings to öğlenleş , akşamlaş and geceleş respectively??!!!! There's word which mean please instead of (lütfen)  I heard it (Nolodo)  I think 😐
Please help me how to say it Thanks, it's very helpful very nice...from india :) cool!! i know mostly of them except of yakinda ,sorun and yarin waooow ı cant spell weel..why iyı öğlenler :ııı uulenles..right? And this is Istanbul Turkish right? teşekkür ederim Who wants to practice Turkish with me? Good job thanks we don't use "iyi öğlenler" at afternoon you should say "iyi günler" literally "good day" Good afternoon =  TÜNAYDIN !!! Tesekorederem Wow surprising how different the accent is compared to what I usually hear (like the last word I hear pronounced teh-shek-you-lair) "Allahaısmarladık" is said by the person who is leaving to the ones who is staying. "Hoşçakal" is same. The one left behind could say "Güle Güle" to the one leaving. güle güle could also be used by both. If you translate "see you soon" literally it means "yakında görüşürüz". It can be used but usually people use "görüşmek üzere" "see you" CAN sombody please tell me why in some videos i see that they say "see you soon" is  gorusmek uzere and in this one it's yakinda gorusuruz and "allah'a ismarladik" for goodbye and gule gule in this video? any help is appreciated, turkish is getting confusing because alot of videos i go to tell me different things. Thank you, I want you more Video so that I can learn the Turkish language Shokran...Salam salaam.marhabah.yakinda gorusuruz..see you soon..hamdhqadrAMAN. When you pronounce iyi oğlenler and iyi akşamlar, you pronounce the very last different than whats written. You pronounced it as iyi ak sham lajjj rather than ak sham LAR. Is that a special case or what  tesekkur ederim =) iyi öğlenler ne lan? iyi günler.  my school is turkish and my teachers are all turkish 
and im not from turkey but i love there 
any way this helped me alot i learnt these in the summer time because of this channel
and now i know how to kinda speak turkish tesukkur edrimAllah'a sei mit dir bitte wer sei mit mir 😂😂😂 wo ist der Rest? Das Video ist mir egal... Ich brauche englische Untertitel... So Netflix gibt es alle folgen und Staffeln Σαν να βλέπω το Ταμάμ (περίπου) Cola=Soda? Hääää? Trotzdem beste Serie😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRRgssrFD4c sorry, but the Greek version is much better. It's recent production and scenery, but mostly the actors are VERY better .. it's called "Tamam"  you can find it and check it yourself! The man who played turkish son has a bad turkish accent. Hard for the understanding. It’s just a one word wish worked about on it.  But father is ok he is talking like from istanbul. Gurke =Pumpkin???Ogosh 👍👍🏻👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Gurke= pumpkin (kürbis) 😂😂😂😂 Gibt's was schlimmeres🤣😂 Hallo Hhhh Gurke. Watch the greek version its better machst du noch mehr do you have the rest in english?  i can't find this show with eng subs unfortunately*your pronunciation is wrong* great way to present the lesson , thnx The translation is horrible. Good Thats sooo good, bu çok iyidir 🔥 teşekkürler 🙏😀 Sucuklu yumurta güğzel göğrüenüyor Is this a test 🤔 It is slow can you do it a little bit more faster bu çok çok yardımcı
Bu bilgi için çok teşekkürler👌👌👌👌👌 I am a native Turkish speaker. I want to improve my English and if there is any english native speaker, we can practise together. I can teach you Turkish. And you can teach me English. (on whatsapp, zoom ect.) Very good in practice, but it needs to be a little slower at times to absorb and process the words. By the time you check the dialogue it is gone. I am enjoying it nonetheless. as a turkish person, they speak so robotic and not natural at all :DI hope no one learns it like this I am from East Blacksea side of Turkey, we speak like 3 times faster than this with a very unique accent. But if you plan on visiting a big city, Turkish people would probably speak slower for you to understand. No one can learn with such a fast speed Who wants to learn Turkish? ???????
Me ,,,,, who else ? لماذا لا نذهب لمشاهدة فيلم يوم السبت المقبل؟
أحتاج أن آتي مع ليلى في الساعة المقبل. يجب لمشاهدة لإن أستطيع أن أشاهد the lady speaks so fast and the man speaks so slow T.T In Hindi we also call book as kitab Very guzel video Türküm jsjsjsj Turkiçe: merhaba kiz ben berta

If we take the commoness in vocabulary, it is one way to make language learning easier Similar words between turkish and indian are due to uzbek language.

Massallah..chok guzel..sevndim Here after watching turkish drama ♥️, love from India (Kolkata)♥️♥️♥️ Hello Upasana, just somehow found your channel and was amazed about your experiences! I'm Turkish too (but born & raised in Germany) and since I know myself I'm a Bollywood fan 🤭 so years ago by watching movies with subtitles I automatically started to learn Hindi, now I (hopefully) could manage an everyday conversation. The problem is that I don't have any practice and experience in really being confronted with speaking fully in Hindi. In October I insha'Allah will be in İstanbul for half a year as an exchange student.. just wanted to ask if it's possible to meet you? It would be amazing!! 💫☘️ Loved your spirit and passion, keep going 👌 Meherba Ben Yukta nasılsın? It's always very exciting to see foreigners taking interest in our culture and language and your accent is very cute! I am learning Turkish from a center and it's very easy for me bcz some words of urdu are very similar with Turkish and after this i am going to apply in turkish Embassy and after this i am going to learn azerbaijani I just learned turkish by seeing turkish dramas...

I see 👀 selin picture 📷 but I can't see her when the class starts.☹☹ this video is not bad well a little bit bad. it seems to me that 'Tamam, o zaman, odanin obur tarafina koyalim' should be 'ok, then, lets put it on the other side of the room' Look at 4:30. "Until early tmrw morning' is not the correct translation. You need to include the full phrase to translate to english Türkçe öğrenmek isteyenlere ben yardımcı olurum öğretirim.

 Keep on pressing the process Wow it's good in Turkish it's bu çok güzel omg I know Turkish 
PLS I recommend to use this vido Very good It's a great help going over it slowly.  Thanks for that. Fantastic It's clear and informative. My first time encounter with turkish is from youtube suggested videos. The video was the introduction to the turkish alphabets. My first thought was " what the f*** is this thing being suggested in which i am not even looking for this..."
Then i clicked the video and i became interested since the alphabet is easy and there is just a few silent letters compared to other languages.... Then my learning continues up to this point. It is so much fun to learn other langauges than the native language that you've been used to. Turkish is easy! Love it! Thank you very much  ✨, this is very helpful Ben 3 aydir çalisiyor türkçe öğrenme. İnsallah yapacagim Çok güzel.Teşekkür ederim I wish I can actually find one with actual single words without a full sentence. Like just put like antagonist without the full agranam 🇹🇷 Good job “She is going  with me tomorrow” that sentence was translated as wrong “geliyor” means coming “gediyor” means going.

Thank you lady, I wish you lots of luck and hope to continue translating. WOW Traduction de toutes les langues en français Tessekur ederim Very clear pronunciation and perfekt speed!
Teşekkür ederim! Thank you so much for this very useful video 💕 Tesekur edrim⚠Merhaba arkadaşlar! We made a translation mistake at 05:01 🤦 That's why we blurred the wrong translation😕 'On bir(11)' is 'eleven' in English. So the translation should be: 'I sleep around eleven o'clock'. We're sorry if it confused you😕 I found these dialogues quite difficult to understand. Need to hit the books Hello. My name is Omid. I download and watch your videos for learning Turkish. May I have your E-mail address? I have some questions to be answered.
Your videos are very helpful. İ have always been confused how to pronounce gerçekten i always say 

Gercektan? 

But she said like giarsektan So easy 👍❤️ For words ending in ‘r’, I can’t make the soft sound I’m supposed to, it sounds either like an English ‘r’ or a more rolled r Hi, I'm samir. I am learning English. Can you help me speak English with me? I can also help you learn Turkish language 📚🙂 Hocam  hello ! how re yu? "i'm fine... "öleli y.y oldu yenilikçi- yenilenmiş videolarla gelin Terrific idea to let us hear native conversations!  More please! Everyone always says that turkic languages sound the same,but I can speak kazakh abd kyrgyz fluently and I only understood like 15% of it. Teşekkürler! Thanks! Спасибо! 👏👏👏 I love the way turkish talking wkwk ❣ Good Please do the same for advanced learners:) maybe like job interview It was really easy
Want to learn more I think the version with subtitles should be after the one without. Just saying. Thanks though ;) For foreign like me, which comes first to learn? Reading, writing, or listening? At university: Binada fiziksel olarak bulunduğunuzda söylenir. Örnek: I am at Hacettepe university.(Hacettepe üniversitesindeyim ama okumuyorum).
In university: Adı geçen üniversitede okuduğunuzu anlatırken kullanırsınız. Örnek I am studying in Yıldırım Beyazıt Uni. I am a Russian-speaking Azeri, but I think I caught almost everything you said! Mutluyum😊Video için teşekkürler!🙏 Thank you, very helpful video. Keşke favori yerine en sevdiğin/m denilseydi, daha Öz Türkçe olurdu. :( Everybody is a boss till a kid talks to you. I understood nothing 😐
As Turkish language is not near similar with Indian subcontinent language (except for the Arabic one's)

But I would love to learn the language 💖🇧🇩💖🇹🇷♥️

By the way the girl speaks amazingly Türkçe ayağına kız ayarlama vidyosu, bende 23 yaşındayım felanlar Teşekürler❤we would be Glad if u make more of this kind of videos, it is so helpful. More realistic conversation...
Türk Erkeği:  Merhaba Adın ne?
Türk Kadını:   Salak mısın sen? Benim sevgilim var biliyor musun?
Türk Erkeği: Sadece Merhaba dedim, nikahıma mı aldım. Very good but to fast for beginners Thanks a lot Thank you so much! I do appreciate this type of videos. Keep on doing them!! It's all persian 😄 I wish this channel had existed when I started to learn Turkish a few years ago. It is definitely a treasure for those who are after online materials for learning Turkish. Way back when I started getting involved with Turkish the available material online was scarce and often contained contradictory information and satisfying explanation about grammar or the usage of certain words was practically non-existent. So I wish I could put this channel into a time machine and send it back to some 6-7 years earlier. It would have spared me a lot of trouble and embarrasing moments. 😁

Since then I have reached a very decent level in Turkish and I’m about to finish my PhD dissertation in Turkish but I still love watching these videos. Actually each video feels like a virtual pat on the back because they make me realise how much I have progressed during these years. I guess what I am trying to say is that I wish the best of luck for those who have recently started to learn Turkish and a million thanks to those who put effort in making these videos. Emeğinize sağlık. İlerideki videoları merakla bekliyorum. 🤓 I understand all the conversation,I always watch Turkish series,😉😁 Bro Alchemist is my favorite also. Thanks alot for this informative video👍 Guys I don't know if you interested in this but most of Turkish words that John ( or can ) teached you are from another languages. For example if you say "teşekkürler" you probably think you said well. But this word is not Turkish word although it's common used word in Turkish. You need to use "sağol" or "varol" for say "thank you". And other hand can used to use formal language in his conversations for make it easy for you. But this kinda conversations are  not that much common. John (can)  did his best. But for make learning easy I recommend you to watch Turkish dramas. 
Freundliche Grüße It was difficult for me  sir because both of you  speaking so fast🥺 Try to understand without subtitles kısmına Türkçesini de yazsaydınız daha güzel olurdu her yerden kelime kapmaları gerek ayrıca dediğim kısımdaki kelimelerde önemli Favori kitabın ne? Türkilizce The fact that she likes Harry Potter, makes me go YAY!!! 😂 Hehe böyle bir sohbet Turkiyenin hiç bir yerinde yoktur ağalar..

I'm practicing it by listening the video starting at 0:26 until 5:48 everyday. So that I can improve my listening comprehension. Hum se na ho paye ga😂😂 5th & 6th conversation was quite hard to me😞but overall I liked this video☺️Teşekkür ederim🤗🇧🇩❤️🇹🇷 The speed of the conversation is not easy to follow so I have to keep repeating the dialogue to read the exact words below,but it's good and well done, thank you Bunu anlamak çok kolay. Lütfen daha çok bu gibi videolar çekin. Çok güzel. Ben Maldivliyim. bende  harry potter cok seviyorum can we use "oyle mi" instead of Gerceten mi?? Pakistan'dan sevgiler Teşekkürler Can! This helped a looooot 🤗 I can’t wait for the day I could converse like this in Turkish. I`m Turkish but it`s still enjoyable lol Teşekkür ederim. Çok ilginç 👍👍👏👏 cok tesekkurederim ❤🙏siz this video is very useful for us to learn  Turkish we love your language love from 🇮🇳India Endonezce çevirisi de var mı 🙏🏻 The Alchemist by Paul Coelho is one of my favorite books too :-) 11 gibi uyuyorum deyip around ten diye geçmişler mi sanki ?:) I have just started to learn turkish and I could understand most of the words  but ofcourse with reading the subtitle first Turkish is very easy We need more dialoge  like this can you please do that I am able to understand many of your phrases as i use to watch lot of turkish series. seriously, Your dizi are awesome..senin dizi cok guzel, gerchetky😁 ❤❤ Türkçe öğretmenleri için çok güzel pratik videoları yaptığınız için teşekkürler Ben Endonezyalıyım, öğrenmek için bu videoya çok beğendım. Teşekkür ederim Can, Funda, Turkishle 👍❤️ Türk olarak bunu izleyen tek ben miyim? We need more of these. Very helpful. Thank you Please more of those videos, this is so helpful 😍😍😍😍😍  greetings from 🇦🇲🇩🇪 All I could hear is only rum rum sun sun 😁😁😄 çünkü I am very beginner in Turkish. Ne kadar güzel olmuş!!! TEBRIKLER!!!!!!!! I always wanted to learn turkish language. This helps. I understand quite a bit Loved this! Please make more I understood it easily because of watching lots and lots of Turkish series. 😄 I'm pretty sure people who following Turkish TV series are interested to learn Turkish as the TV channels usually don't deliver subtitles for international viewers. It was very fast for the beginers. Ben her şeyi anladım, CC yoksa bide. I appreciate your work Can. You must keep up the good work and never stop. But please let me give you some advice.. Non-Turkish people are not used to ask to strangers '' where they are from'' when they meet for the very first time. And I personally find this question as much irritating as it can be. I know that you are trying to teach Turkish with Turkish way of thinking but you could have been and still can be more polite. Some may consider it differently, that's my opinion. Good luck.I love turkish ❤️ En sevdiğim öğretmen Selin😊😊😁 You had nice dress today. En sevdiğim araba bmwdir Wish i can speak Turkçe flucent like English you are doıng such a great job.Tessekular Yaklaşık 3 sene önce Türkiye’ye ilk geldiğimde Sizin videolarınızı izleyerek Türkçe öğrenmeye çalışıyordum ve gerçekten çok faydasını gördüm iyi ki varsınız. Emeğinize sağlık :) Thanks for your video,, but this was about sentence structure,  and not how to use a word or phrase in different situations. 
Sentence structure would be something like subject-object-verb, etc. Your lessons are excellent. Thank you very much 🙏 Merhaba.. can you pls help me with translating this song for school purpose.. I need to dance with this song but I am really afraid to do it without knowing its meaning.  I tried to research but I cant find satisfactory info. hope you can help me with this.

Will you keep the background plan without decoration or photo (when you type a word) lutfan It is so hard to learn I can learn Turkish from this channel En sevdigim Istanbul Would you give us lessons about economy Hey! I wanted to ask why we use “nin”.. I mean what’s the use of “nin”? What does that means. What means “im” at the end ... Ben-Im ad-im ??? This was really helpful or useful. I think it was my favorite Turkish lesson so far. Now I know much more about Turkish. But there's, of course, a lot more I need to know about the language.

Just a useful app I use is called HiNative. You can ask any question about various languages, countries, and cultures, and then residents of the country and native speakers of the language will answer you. You can even ask how to pronounce words. Tessekur ederim Why dont u wear hijab?? I love turkish, but not u so called western turkish.. I Love Turkish language.. It's so beautiful language. ❤️❤️🇵🇰 Really it's very good to learn 
I love Turkish❣️❣️💐💐 Its ne kadar or ne kadash how to pronounce it? This is for y'all guys. If you trying to learn Turkish and looking a person who speaks Turkish as a native person, just tell me. I can help you! Loved it :) I love turkish please do more videos please okay teacher selin

What's the difference between “Tuvalet" and “Banyo" in Turkish because I don't understand!! Please! Help me!!!! Ben türkçe öğrenmek bitiriyorum sonra türkiye geliyorum bende antalya'yı seviyorum So kıyafet and elbise are both synonyms for dress? If so, which one is mostly used? 🙃 I like selin she teach very well☺ If is there anyone who wants to learn turkish I can help, I am a native turkish speaker and I graduated from english preparatory school and I want to improve it more. What I want to say we can help each other. If you want text me please, let's teach each other our mother languages :)) Looking gorgeous as always It’s been long So good to see you selin i need someone to conversate in turkish because we cant speak it without practicing It´s incredible how many Latin words there are in Turkish, apparently borrowed from French (because of the pronuntiation). That makes them similar to Portuguese "Estação" , Spanish "Autobus" (Portuguese "Ônibus"), French "Toilette" (Portuguese, originally from French, "Toalete"), and "Lavabo", which is the same as Portuguese, ipsis litteris (and straight from Latin "I wash"). And here in São Paulo, Brasil, which received immigrants from the Ottoman Empire during WWI, everyone knows what "kafta" means. And of course, Portuguese "Música"...

It's amazing 😍😀 Uhhhhh there is ğ🙄 I like this channels!!! Very helpful eywallah kardash,  cok guzel the most easiest language for Pakistan.😊 Hi Can, çok teşekkürler. I'm still not clear about the difference between C and J, it sounds very similar. Is there any way to distinguish these two? The pronunciation of "R" at the end of the word also troubles me a lot, why it sounds like "sh" ? For example, "ver", to me it sounds like "vesh" Great🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰 Thank you. It's really helpful.
Though it seems confusing because all Turkish letters look similar to English letters.
Hope with time being will be easy. I am confused with the letter "I", does it sound like the letter "ы" in Russian? Selam ! Sir . I am Indian Muslim , What about turkish vowel and consonant ? ç harfini unutmuşsunuz :D Perfect ❤️❤️ Assalamu alaikum . interesting some of Turkish words r present in Pashto language .n sound of the alphabets r same with Pashto alphabets 😊 Thank you so much!

I simply watch it again, until I'm certainly sure. Bu kanal daha da çok izlenmeyi hak ediyor, çok iyi gidiyorsun ☺️👍🏻 Bunların paraları 10 katı oldu millet türkçe öğrenmeye başladı Bravo, başarılar dilerim 👍🏼 Audio is too low. Very nice language Merhaba. Dilimizi dünyaya tanıttığınız için teşekkür ederim. Umarım bir çok insana ulaşırsınız. Başarılar diliyorum... Are you Turkish because you talk as though what you are saying comes naturally to you but it is not the case for learners; it is a complex language that does not make sense to - in my case - an English speaker. I think it needs a native English speaker to explain Turkish because s/he will understand the problems involved. For me, your explanations make it even more complicated and some things just leave me totally confused. Sorry! Mast ha style of training language nice Great work 👍👍👍 English is a terrible language to use as a reference. Love from Pakistan Excellent explanations. I am trying to learn with the you. I am a new subscriber. Thanks a bunch for your sincere efforts 😊👏. Pizza seviyorum would be I am liking pizza? Are you an Indian My mother tongue is Bengali.
Bengali and Turkish both are gender free language 🔥❤️ Got the inspiration to learn Turkish after watching Magnificent century 😂 Got a very good lesson and it helped me a lot to understand it more clearly after watching your tutorial video!! 🇮🇳🇹🇷 Really, this is the most intelligent language teaching I have ever come across! Turkish is fascinating and I am hooked. I am from South India and don't know much Urdu but at least three of these words are familiar to us (probably from Chagtai) - can, rahat, shahir. Omg! I have been looking for these! You are amazing, thank you for sharing this content, please keep with the lessons 🙏 Thanks I like it.🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷 Please raise your voice next time. We can't hear you well.thanks anyway . Please put English subtitles to this videos!!!!

Thank you so much !!!’n Great Thank you! Excited to pick up Turkish again :) Am here to learn turkish coz am getting married to a turkish man So will following your Turkish learning playlist be a good place to start from 0? Aoa!sir i'm from pakistan but my mother language is persian so it's too easy for me to learn turkish vocabulary .Thanks for these classes these r very helpful I am from somalia .
I like Turkish language so much and it is  so easy for me because we have more similarities both languages like alphabet  sound and gramatic order even it Heyyy ! Its really hatss offf !!!!!! How much time did u took for learning Turkish language 😌 Lectures seviyourum I can say n Turkish heheh Siz ders çok fiadyli hocam Siz ders çok fiadyli hocam Thank you for sharing, this is genuinely helps me a lot to understand the pattern as a beginner. Woah! I was flabbergasted on how he delivered it and how Turkish language really works bec of bıt complexity with grammar and vocabulary but this one... 🔝 💯 Awaiting for more ❤️
🇵🇭🇹🇷 Mükemmel.... I am from Bangladesh 🇧🇩, 😊 Thanks for the great lesson hocam. Can't wait for the next one.tesekkurler. benim cok mutluyum. i have completed sekiz lectures. HiHermoso idioma espero aprender pronto, gracias por esos vídeos hacen mas fácil lograr una buena pronunciación. Saludos!! Thank you thank u tesekkur ediremçok teşekkür ederim this shit doesnt load good than youGet your FREE account here: https://goo.gl/dWu95Y What part of beginners  you don't understand? You're going to fast 👎👎👎👎 That's a beginner course ! Çok zor !! This is not suitable for absolute beginners. There is use of the conditional tense and future tense structures, among a few other  more grammatically complex structures for novice language learners of Turkish. Unless these are being used as expressions to memorize, they are not realistic for absolute beginners to learn, particularly, if they have never had exposure to Turkish language or an agglutinative language, previously. The future tense would be suitable for level 1-2 and conditional tense for level 2-3, but certainly not absolute beginner. Its too fast .. why turkish people speak too fast.
I dont understand anything 😭😓 the woman speaks way too fast but otherwise this is a good video 50 days on duo lingo and have not got a clue what's being said. Turkish is a looooooooong long road. Seriously!!!!!!!! Turkish is especially hard and requires a lot of devotion because a word can be changed in multiple ways. Even if I know what a word "oğlu" means, I can not instantly figure out what 'oğlunun' fırst time I hear it because sounds very different.
Also 'en uzun' sounds lıke 'enüz' which confused me a lot Horrible lesson. Perfectly well explained! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 I'm absolute absolute beginner cause these are still hard for me. maybe next month I'll understand these Türkçe çok kolay aslında 😂
İngilizce ile arapça öğreniyorum bende Tessekurler. Ben turkce ogreniyorum It is really so hard Soooooooo hard 😢😢😢😢 First comment 😂
Teşekkürler arkadaşlar ❤️🇹🇷❤️And they say it's similar to Arabic where can i get a pdf of the lists? How cool, thanks! thank you so much
