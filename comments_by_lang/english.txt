I wrote a code for the exercise 2:12:07      Can someone explain to me why the number 62 isn't being removed from the list and every duplicate number was removed?

numbers = [2,5,1,62,45,54,9,1,5,48,6,9,50,9,45,9,62,54]
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)
for num in numbers:

        numbers.remove(num)
        print(numbers)
numbers.reverse()        
print(numbers) Thank you sir for taking the time not only educating us but also the effort in making this video.  Very grateful for this tutorial! Sir, i need to be a software developer, but confused whether to learn Python or Java or Javascript or C# pls help Hi! Its problem video 1:47:47 you have one answer "Total:60" but I have three ansers: "Total:10; Total: 30: Total 60" Whats worng? Thx! Thank you so much , Sir ‚ù§Ô∏è Progress
33:07 Hah for me it's a personal challenge.
Coding was my bane for a long time, so it's to challenge myself. well the application i thought of was a game .but thanks a lot for this tutorial.i learned a lot from you! windows 10 emoji shortcut:
Windows Key + . Key Hi, the cheat sheet goes to a 404 page. Mosh, great video. I am a Unix systems administrator, any hints on other videos that are related to my work I should watch? THANK YOU SO MUCH MOSH. I was wasting time copying and pasting code from tutorials but after finishing this i feel confident that i can code by myself. You brought me much closer to my goal, I don't know how to thank you.(Also shared the video with my friends). I want to be a  software engineer, and i also learn cyber scurity and white(ethical) hacking Thanks so much for this Mr. Mosh. Having gone through the course up to dictionaries, I have a few points to critique. 
1: empty strings are used a few times with much explanation, maybe is so obviously simple but to a green like me it isn't.
2: when you give an exercise, you utilize the current lesson and even some previous lessons‚Äîgreat
But please give us a hint of what to use, supplying the puzzle pieces and having students put them together. Some activities I just had no idea how to start

Example using += and .get in dictionary activity I don't have a comp... I feel like a hacker :o I got his ad on his own video haha :D At time stamp Receiving input.
The solution i put is like this.
name = Input(' what is your name? ')
Print('hi ' + name)
Fav_colour = input(' what is your favourite colour? ')
Print('its ' + fav_colour).

And it gave me the right answer, did i over do it? Your a god of python I didn't find any 1 like who explains this easy. I am from an accounting background. your super fantastic I am really excited to learn further more thanks for making this kind of video. I wish I will more of your's on others languages as well(HTML, CSS, JAVAscript etc etc.) looking forward to learn through you sir. Thank you so much for the useful course !!

For 2:12:00  I tried another solution 

for num in numbers:
      if numbers.count(num) != 1 :
         numbers.remove(num)
print(numbers) What's it wrong plz?

This is an amazing course, yet I'm having trouble finding your csv at 4:33:48, the website dssplays 404 error. Can you please fix this? From the UK, GCSE computer science student.

Nested Loops Challenge:

A simpler way to do it is:

numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]

for list in numbers:
    list *= 'x'
    print(list)


Lists Exercise:

A simple way:

list = [1, 2, 3, 1414, 352515, 7, 836, 981818471841847184, 8263, 42, 00, 1923]



list.sort()   ----> This sorts all the numbers in an ascending order





print(f'Largest number is {list[-1]}') I am residing in India .
I am B.Tech Student i am learning Python to work as a web Developer.
Thank you so much sir, for providing the course :) its so weird if you dont have a start index for a string the last character at the end index is included but if you do have a starting index the last character is forgotten about very good content. Excellent explanations and every aspect serves a clear purpose. thanks for your efforts can anyone have a cheat sheet of python provided by @Mosh ? If Statement Exercise = 

value = input("The houses total value is $1,000,000, Is your credit score good?  "  )


if value.upper() == "Y":
    print('You need to put down $100,000 which is 10% of the entire house as a down payment ')

elif value.upper() == "N":
    print('You need to put down $200,000 which is 10% of the entire house as a down payment ')

else:
    print("Get the fuck out of here you broke ass shit, You can't buy a house ") Hi, its really great. very easy to understood. I am trying to download the FREE Python cheat sheet from your description but it's not working. can you please fix he issue. Thanks. what is that font? I've coded a code called Lua before, and it is extremely similar to python, so I feel as if I shouldn't struggle too much with coding python bots and what not. Thank you for the course! Yea, the gap is still open.! After more then a decade.! Mosh ! You‚Äôre a lifesaver 1:30:58 I've been following the course from scratch and I'm close to finish. I have a question, in 5:41:12 when I create the product Orange an operationalError appears. Can someone tell my what this error means thank you!!! 1:12:27 hey Mosh to me you are the best Do you teach hacking? Thanks @Programming with Mosh your video helped me. can you pls make a windows tutorial im a little late to the party, but im going through this course and im at the nested loop challenge, my initial solution was this: 
numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]

for x in numbers:
    for y in numbers:
        y = '*' * x
    print(y)
i was proud for a second and then realized i cheated :D Thanks so much for making this. I've been using python for years now, but it was mostly learned on the job and this is helping me fill in the gaps and brush up! can u please teach  colabnotebook 2:28:46 in Windows we need to hold down Windows key and press '.' or ':' button üòÅüòÅ where can i get vs code This course is best because he is from iran üáÆüá∑‚ù§Ô∏è in the car project why did he set the value of started to False and not True? This tutorial is really amazing... I subscribed the channel because I think this is the best python course in Youtube ever uploaded and I would recommend other people watching it properly to gain a massive knowledge about python. This video helped me very much and Thanks to Mosh. Its 2021 and im.playing this video 20 minutes now..i want to learn programming for my future i didn,t recieve the cheat Sheet /watch?v=fHXfX9_jO9g&t=4s&ab_channel=NEWPROJECTS It says ‚Äúprocess finished with exit code 0‚Äù without my name why does it do that? Mosh: in the challenge where you have to print a ‚ÄòF‚Äô with Xs, in your solution you define the inner loop to be repeated ‚Äòx_count‚Äô number of times, which is 5, then 2 and so on‚Ä¶. However when we define a number in a range, I thought it would take all number below the defined range, which in this case should have been 4, then 1, then 1 and so on‚Ä¶. No? 28.10

If this were real rather than a  commercial, you know that the little granddaughter would be speaking and understanding Polish because she learned the language from her Polish dad.

My knowledge of the signs 10 seconds later: Adios I was reading a manhwa where the main character cant hear and uses sign, this got me curious. So i decided to check out asl. I am gonna try learning it too Hey everyone I work in a bakery so it's helpful to know sign language to explain to deaf customers the different types of baked goods etc. P.s. i learned to sign fluently in one week so can you! I don't know why I'm learning ASL if it's not the signal language of my country ;-; Ah yes, thanks Youtube for recommending this so I can learn sign language and impress that imaginary deaf girl in my class. I am here Incase I have to bullshit to strangers when I am too nervous to talk I m deaf .i m from india .its like usa help teach on talk .. my name is Ashley and when i read "my name is Ashely" in the video i was like "AYYYYYYY" Hi Ashley I've became hard of hearing and have been watching your videos to learn to sign because my hearing is not getting better but just wanted to say I love watching your videos i wanna learn asl so i could communicate with the girl who usually orders at the place i work. i wanna learn sign cuz my friend knows sign and i wanna have a secret language with her .. hello again  I get feel well before I went to hosptial for two weeks  done,  I was surgery final out by tumor inside of side face,,  whew , I AM FEEL STILL WELL HEALTH CARE NOW,, OK my ass really tried to put the volume up to 100 so i can hear... i watched super nanny the other day with that one episode of the deaf parents and all kids are full hearing
made me wanna learn it just in case
and i used to have friends who were like half deaf and such and there's a few kids in my school who are deaf
so i just wanna learn it in case it's ever needed
i know most of the abcs (p, q, r are a bit heart to remember and g) and most everything in this video And I just want to know I'm left handed so can I learn using my left? I'm a hawker and I'm feeling stupid when I can't communicate with other people. So there's once I encounter a group of deaf people and I just standing there like smilling while holding my phone trying to communicate using writing. But instead they just nicely pointing out what they want to buy and showing numbers on their fingers probably confirming the price. And I just nodded. And after they purchased I just bow a bit trying to thank them.
I really want to become an awesome hawker that can communicate with everyone. And English is not my first language. I learned it a bit from my days at school and by myself. Thank you for this  channel! It's my favorite.  You've  taught me so much. The slow motion of the signs is the best. I'm actually afraid of deaf people because one time I was with them inside a van they were next to me (2 people) and they were signing so hard they always hit me with their elbows, and I couldn't tell them that it hurt. So I endured it for the whole trip :( *Preparing for my future kid, incase they become deaf* just in case i meet a cute deaf girl learning because my girlfriends parents are deaf and i want to better communicate with them:) my uncle has 10% hearing in both ears and these videos are really helping me out. he's going deaf slowly Now i can finally talk to my deaf cat I came here so when someone tells me to put a mask on I can just say I‚Äôm deaf. watch "the silent child" short film and learn the importance of learning sign language oh my goodness thank you so much!! I've wanted to connect with my in-law for the longest!! you're awesome!! how to sign you are hot ? thankyou for learning Im here because me and my friend random thought one day it would be cool to learn sign soooo now here i am... Of the 5 languages I know ASL is not one, I must learn !! Its 2am! Just watched "Silent Child" short film and then I'm here! i forgot all of them already Thank you soo much dear üòÑ Thank you so much for this! I've been extremely hard of hearing since completely losing my hearing in one ear overnight in 2014 and my remaining hearing is pretty bad. Thank you for posting this. I watched an episode of Little House on the Prairie last week, and the episode involved one of the main characters teaching sign language to a teenager who was deaf. It inspired me to learn ASL. Thank you for these lessons! I am really liking ASL. I have been practicing every day for a few weeks now and am loving it more and more! im learning sign language just in case i get invited to be a part of a converstion i dont wanna be part of or someone in the public calls me out and i can ignore them i wonder can we use the hand we want or must we use just one of them? Thankyou, I‚Äôve been wanting to learn sign language for a while but I struggle with learning at times.... though I‚Äôve just memorised all of these in 20 minutes and will make this a nightly thing. Perfect video üôåüèª Thank you for your efforts
Please, can you give me a list of static(without movement) words of American Sign Language?
Thank you in advance I want to learn bc I have a co worker who is deaf and I feel like he‚Äôs lonely and has nobody to interact with ü•≤ I‚Äôm hear after watching GVK and seeing all the sign language and actually want to learn it Thank you for this easy tutorial for beginners! I thought there's sum wrong with my earphones How is the sign of Bill Gates in ASL? Am i the only one  who is adjusting the volume üéßüîäüîä I'm trying to relearn ASL to help a patient of mine out she seems understandably frustrated with the barriers placed in front of her There is a deaf deaf in my school and so I‚Äôm trying to learn sign I'm so glad I found this. I'm a Massage Therapist and I had a deaf client today. With the mask mandate, I felt so bad that I couldn't talk to her. Thank you!! English is my second language and I'm here to learn a third one. I'm amazed by ASL. Thanks! üñêüèºüôÇ Well learning this because of creeps I love the slo mo.
It's JUST what I need. I though my headphones weren't working, oops I saw a story where people living in a locality learned sign language to surprise their deaf neighbour and I was like damnn.. Someday if I meet a deaf person I would be acting so dumb and can't even talk.. Damn I need to learn it.pluspoint I can also use it when I'm angry and tired and I don't want to scream. You know energy saving peaceful agitation. I can only say: ‚ÄòHello! My name is Kat. What‚Äôs your name? Nice to me you. I know a little sign..‚Äô I‚Äôve been practicing real hard to remember these signs, now I‚Äôm ready to surprise my blind friend! I'm an introvert so I must know sign in order to avoid talking. Yes I am big brained üòé I‚Äôm doing this instead of English class Thank you. I sure wish I'd learned sign language in Jr. High, as I had a crush on a deaf boy, and I was too shy to speak anyway. when people yell at you all the time because you can't hear them, you quit trying to talk, and learn how to "act" like you are hearing them, by matching facial expressions, laughing when they do, etc. If you ask them to repeat, they'll usually yell at you. Anyway, grateful for these lessons, as I'm half deaf now. Progressive hearing loss. And to "talk" to others....what a joy. "am grateful for my hearing" button This is so helpful. Thank you. Thank you for this. Im trying to learn to communicate with my husband. One day his hearing will be completely gone. My name is Cameron Hull and i work at starbucks and i am watching this video just in case....lol Did I really just get done eating left over Panda Express and instead of sleeping had the sudden need to learn sign language? Yes, yes I did. Thank you so much for doing this. I was taught the ASL alphabet and basic signs as a child in Girl Guides back in the mid-70‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs been quite a while since I‚Äôve signed with anyone and I‚Äôve been trying to remember what I was taught those many years ago. (You just never know when you might end up needing to sign & understand ASL, as I discovered one summer not long after I‚Äôd first been taught beginner ASL). 

My family and some of my parents friends with kids the same age as my brothers and I were all travelling & vacationing together with RV‚Äôs and we‚Äôd stopped to camp at a lakeside RV campground in Chase, BC for a week or two. I was born with a genetic condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (type C), and most days walking or even sitting could be very painful for me at that age. I‚Äôve always been fairly shy and a bit of a loner, preferring the company of dogs to people, (still do tbh, lol), and on our 3rd day there when all the other kids & my two older brothers were off racing around, I had chosen to stay sitting with our family dog near the shoreline. While I was there, an middle aged male I didn‚Äôt know came over and started attempting to talk to me. 

I knew better than to talk to a stranger, and refused to answer any questions I was asked. I became quite frightened by his repeated attempts at getting my attention, and got up to leave. My brothers and the other kids were out of sight at that point, and as I turned to leave, the man suddenly grabbed me by the arm. My dog instantly reacted by growling and placing herself between the stranger and I, but she was just a little terrier/dachshund/chihuahua mix, and not exactly the worlds most terrifying sight. He still immediately let go of me, but by then I was in tears and so frightened I couldn‚Äôt move OR scream - and as I looked wildly around for someone to help, a young man in his late teens suddenly came running up out of nowhere and literally shoved the man away from me, and then proceeded to also stand in front of me along with my by then VERY upset dog. He didn‚Äôt say a word, but merely clenched his fists at his sides and glared at the older man - who clearly decided it was time to leave, and quickly left the area. 

The teenager turned to me with a concerned look, and began wiping my tears with his sleeve...but just smiled at me after and didn‚Äôt say anything. Just then my brothers and the other kids appeared off in the distance, so I quickly thanked him and my dog and I made our way over to rejoin the others as quickly as I could. After telling them what had happened, my brothers also wanted to thank him so we returned to where it had happened, but the boy was gone. Two days later when we were back out on the beach, this time with our folks (who were also very concerned about what had happened & had filed a report with the local RCMP), I noticed that the young man who‚Äôd helped me was fishing over on the very long dock that was the local tourist attraction. My parents and I went over to where he was and as they began to thank him, I noticed him staring very intently at my folks as they spoke and for some reason began to suspect he might be deaf or hard of hearing. My suspicion was instantly proven correct when after they‚Äôd thanked him, he smiled and signed ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù. My parents didn‚Äôt understand ASL, but I sure did and I immediately began signing ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to him over & over. He seemed absolutely taken aback for a second, and just lit up in a brilliant ear to ear smile. Turned out I was the first person he‚Äôd met outside of his family who could sign even rudimentary level ASL. 

After introducing myself & exchanging names, my folks invited him and his grandmother, (whom he lived with), to join us for supper that evening, and by the end we were all fast friends - he was the same age as my eldest brother and he was immediately included into our little multi-aged group. (His grandmother later said that evening was happiest she‚Äôd seen Terry since the death of his parents 6 years earlier). I happily spent the rest of our eventually extended time there that summer doing my best to translate for him whenever he needed. We continued to stay in touch for several years, and would see him whenever we‚Äôd go back to Chase in the summertime. 

Sadly, eventually the day came when the letters stopped & the phone number we had for his grandmother was discovered to be out of order. When we arrived there a couple of months later, we immediately went to their home, only to find he had moved on from the area following the death of his grandmother about a month after what was to be his final letter. The neighbours unfortunately didn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôd moved and we sadly never did see him again. I‚Äôve thought of him often through the years - I will never know what might‚Äôve happened if he hadn‚Äôt been there that day, and am always so grateful we met & I was able to communicate with him thanks to having being taught basic ASL by the Girl Guides. I actually speak several other languages as well, and made sure to teach my own children what I‚Äôd been taught by both Terry & the Guides - it was actually the second language i taught them as little ones. Yet again the importance of knowing even rudimentary ASL was brought home when one of my then 9 year old eldest son‚Äôs best friends lost his hearing in a car accident. 

I recently read that some believe that ASL is in danger of dying out due to lack of funding for teaching. If true, this would have tragic ramifications for the deaf and hard of hearing communities, which makes videos like yours are even more valuable and important than ever. Thank you!! I thought it would be a great idea to learn to sigh. I am a cashier and have a few customers that sigh. ü•∞ She is going quite quickly. i have decided to learn some sign language in case if i meet someone who signs and because i want to anyone else? 0:03 Hello

3:12 How to sign _____? I want learn ASL but I from UK i use BSL and I am deaf Hope I going holiday will use ASL :) If it‚Äôs too quiet just turn your volume up üëçüèª eowew I'm learning sign incase my tinnitus worsens. I'm also learning incase I ever meet someone whom I want to be friends with is deaf of hoh. Thank you so much for slowing down hand signs Just watched the anime a silent voice and it hit me so hard that I must learn sign language or just exist. I dont know anyone who is deaf, I just felt I owe this to them in case I met someone deaf, its easy everyone should learn it Is this vid mirrored or should I be practicing with opposite hands? I wanna talk to the deaf people I work with :) Sklvgkfrz
Emma as much as the sighns are good you were going preety fast can you try to slow down a bit pls My best friend was diagnosed deaf a couple weeks ago.i promised her before she went deaf i would learn it for her. Its a bit hard to remember but ill remember it. I promise. My dad has been dead since he was 5 and I am fluent in ASL but I want to get better. 2 small flexes: My first words were in ASL and I taught ASL to KU basketball players when I was 2. ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ü I learned the alphabet when I was a kid and it stuck with me all these years. Nowadays I can‚Äôt get diddly squat to stick in my head so I keep watching vids like these. Does it matter which hand you use for one handed signs? I'm left handed, so I feel like I'm probably favoring the wrong hand. EDIT: Nevermind, just saw her "left/right hand" FAQ video. im learning sign for a few reasons

i wanna learn because my friend/guy i like is mute so i wanna understand him or communicate with him. 

another reason is because i wanna have kids. just incase i have a kid who is deaf or mute, i can teach them

lastly, im going deaf so i guess thats a pretty valid reasonüòª I came here cuz I felt like learning sign language and I went to the comments. Now I wanna watch the anime ‚ÄúA Silent Voice‚Äù. My best friend's GF is deaf, he knows ASL and I wanted to learn too so he doesn't have to always translate for us. Very excited to learn! these videos help so much :) Is it necessary to raise your eyebrows when doing sign language? Why? I wanna download this video for later so I can teach to my deaf students. 
I downloaded this video once but now I have to pay for it. I am simply learning because recently I have been going through a  lot of stress and talking  is just stressful and I dont want to quite simply also I had been planning on learning asl for a bit I Used To Have An ASL Class In Collab In Elementary School and I was really interested since there was a deaf dependant there too and the kids would come and play Aswell but, the only reason why I'm pretty sure everyone hated that class was because of the teacher, they were mean, disrespectful, strict (Stricter Than normally strict) Would Yell And Get Mad When We Couldn't Remember The Sign And Get Extremely Mad When We Wanted To Go To The Bathroom And Almost No One Wanted To Go Anymore But Thankfully she left In 1 Month I'm Pretty Sure. awesome video Hi, thank you for offering this! So helpful!! I don‚Äôt use Instagram so I cannot follow you there but will here on YouTube. I have a question, Do I mirror you? If I mirror you, I‚Äôd be using my left hand, I.e. pointing to me or you. Or do I use my right hand mostly? Thanks! Watching Ginny and Georgia brought me here I guess my volume key is bad I wanna learn it to help and talk with deaf people by asl languahe ‚ù§‚ù§ I work in sales, and sometimes I get deaf customers. The other day I got one and he was really interested in the product but I had a hard time communicating with him. I'm hoping next time he comes I can be more helpful and with my other customers as well.Waw sir apki speech Tq sir üôè Sir full pronunci full series I am a student.

Mai English nahi'n janta, lekin itna pata hai ke jo Sikha rahe hai vo positive mind se sikha rahe hai. Unka Dil se Shukriya man'na chahiye. 
Sikhane wala hamesha Guru hota hai chahe kisi se bhi Sikh rahe Ho. 
Jo Kisi Eilm Dene wale ka Adar nahi'n karta vo TaaZindagi Kora hi rahta hai. 

Jab bhi koi sikha raha ho us ka Abhar (shukriya) man'na chahiye. Jaha bhi, Jis se bhi sikhne ko mile, Sikh lo0..! Chahe kisi diwar par hi kyu'n na likha ho!!? 

Mahve Tasbih hi to sab hai magar Idraaq kahaa'n?
Zindagi khud hi Eibadat hai magar ho≈Ñsh nahi'n..!

In ke kuchh video Maine dekhe, samajh me aate hai. Kabhi kuchh baat samajh nahi'n aati to free time me fir se Dekhta hu'n. 

Agar koi bat samajh nahi'n aati to us me ghalti sikhane wale ki nahi'n. 

Baris sabhi jagah ek si hoti hai lekin pahad us pani ko sambhal nahi'n pata kyo'nki us ka sar Uncha kiya huve hai. Sarkhez Matti bane'n. 
Time tha to likh diya. bura lage vo mujhe bura likh Sakte Ho lekin raat ko Sochna ke aapne sahi kiya yaa ghalat?? 
Positive rahiye.

I am preparing my team at the moment. I want to know can you work with us? If it is interesting for you, I can write everything about the project. is 2021 now, i'm learning with that course but some commands isnt working, i guess the sql maybe have change some commmands, maybe i'm using a new version of sql, i am not sure about that(im brazilian because that my english is very bad) What's the database design tool? Hey man,  you explain SQL very well and effectively. I really appreciate your efforts and thanks a lot for this wonderful lesson. can't download popsql I watched and coded along to the entire course and it was 100% worth the time investment! I knew nothing about SQL going into this course, but now after completing it I feel comfortable writing my own SQL queries and designing databases for data science projects.

for 4th value in the works_with table what should i do? You so good If anyone is having trouble connecting the database with popsql, and you're getting the unknown database error, it might be because you did the same thing as me. In the video he spelled the name of the database when creating it "girrafe" and I just typed the same thing, but when attempting to connect I spelled it "giraffe" because I wasn't just copying down what I saw. I didn't see anyone else with this problem so I might just be dumb, but hopefully this helps if you've made the same mistake. Gud luck learning :) 38:38 Did you just flip me off??!!     lol jk Thanks for this great video. Really helping me learning!

Can someone explain me why you would use SQL instead of just Excel? It seems like all those queries can be easily done with Excel too. Is it because these databases can hold more information than Excel? I feel pity for him coz he always says relational database management system instead of RDBMS.üòÖüòÇ Thank you for helping a lot of people with your tutorial. Man, 1 hour just explaining what a Database is?  I just couldn't finish viewing your video. I was expecting something more hands on and not just talking? Besides, this was SQL tutorial.

This is the problem The urban fight is very good channelClick the "JOIN" button below the video to support freeCodeCamp.org! Well put together video. There is no filler here, just the right information given at the right time. Anybody can lecture but to be able to organize it so well was impressive. Best video on here. Thank you for this tutorial. Mike is my favourite teacher Please remove ads, its very irritating love your lessons 1:14:00 important question. when using code block, for some reason i can't use my cursor properly and edit my code without it deleting anything, if that makes sense, does anyone knows how to fix this? Yo! It's my first time ever getting into programming do you guys recommend me to start from this video or should i get some basics first or is this video enough to begin with? Can you follow this course with Microsoft visual ?
My eyes can't handle codeblocks whats the difference between cout and printf its all good but gets confusing after getters and setters lol I saw that fire logo in asphalt 9 club logo catalog Dear google no matter how many ads you show us, we buy them only if we want not because you showed some fucking ads..... hi guys.. can you all help me out here a little bit.. just started learning to code but when I open the app, it doesn't have the management and workspace as it was in 10:10 . I don't know how I'm supposed to write them innitially forgive me lord for i have cinned Watched this course for 2 days and aced my interview on the 3rd! for the guessing game one, the while loop thing in it, i am getting  error code C4700 = uninitialized local variable 'guess' used. how do i fix? Your A Legend Thanks A lot use double instead of float as a beginner for one decimal place? Has anyone pass the C++ certification exam simply off this video? Asking for a friend ü§î why not just use visual studio 720p. ÂòªÂòª i was eating cheese while watching Thank you üòä‚ù§Ô∏è 1:13:10 XD I'm here to learn how to code custom enemies in my Newer Wii hack. any free books for someone with previous coding experience who wants to learn cpp to suggest? cout << 6+9*6+9; 1:15:57, aren't those lucky numbers from the show 'Lost', where they were the unlucky numbers lmao I request you to make an advanced C++ course also Thanks For your knowledge sharing & information today is my first day learning C++. 64 lakh views, congratulations freecodecamp,you deserve even more views. üíê Awesome! ‚ù§ It's easy to handle strings in C++ then in C. watching this already knowing some computer languages be like:‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí... wait what?‚Üê‚Üê...... understood‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí‚Üí still a good tutorial, especially for the fact that this dude finally managed to explain to me, what getters and setters are good for after 2.5 f*cking years. 11:18 you mean binary machine language? Thank you, it was extremely helpful. üëå can you explain to me how 10:41 is the most basic code of c++, that's the most complicated thing I ever saw the array part doesn't work for me. I copied everything he did I'm sure of it but for some reason it doesn't work. There's a problem with the int part someone help.
What I had written:

int luckyNums[ ]  =  {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};         (this is the problem and idk what I did wrong)
 
cout << luckyNums[ 0 ]; The dislikes are from teachers who are mad that some giraffe guy taught their entire class in 4 hours the 20.03 version is a pain to download but it's done hours of waiting and watching For the calculator I made a version where the user inputs something like 10+5, and the program automatically identifies the operation and slices the input into parts to do it. Had an absolute blast making it :D The sleepy hood corroboratively attack because spoon precisely touch but a natural rule. lying, bite-sized ocean I am learning C++ so I can make games. Unreal engine use C++ and blueprint he just great "Biraffe Academy" This guy is one heck of a Comedian:):):):) As soon as you got to Switch statements, I immediately thought of YandereDev and his thousands of else if's in his coding. DONE finally now time to start competitive programming with c++ Hello sir I want to learn programming but I haven‚Äôt enough money to cost programming classes I'm here because my professor has a deep accent and I can't understand a single word he says lol at 2:21:45 ... i typed this code word by word now, because nothing was working before. But it still says that my variable "guess" in line 9 is not initialized. why does it run for him but not for me?
I use visual studio, could this be a problem? I'm a mechanical engineer, what am I doing here getline didnt work This dude teach a concept, then shows an example, easy to understand! 2:26:00 uhmm this code is hella long. u can do it sorter with a || in the while loop. and if they break out look at if its correct or not





This is what i think is better.
BTW Thanks for this amazing tutorial on c++ it really helped me with starting

int main(){


	int secretNum = 7;
	int guess;
	int Tries = 0;

	do {
		cout << "Enter guess: ";
		cin >> guess;
		Triess++;

	}while(Tries != 10 || guess != secretNum);
	
	if (guess == secretNum){
		cout << "You win!";
	} else{
		cout << "You lose!";
	}
		
} I start it right now . See you later . I am gonna write a review down here : Thank you so much!!!!, I have a final twm and this made it clear :D!!!! 21:14 You forgot to mention the exact link for code blocks c++ 31:27 As a retired person with too much idle time on my hands, I have been watching / learning from this video.  Great stuff !  However, I was really hoping you would give an example of how to generate random numbers.  I am a math / physics guy and in what I am trying to do I need to generate random numbers. i am getting "count was not declared in this scope" everytime what should i do.
when i am executing the data type Can this be used in hame development?? This guy is awsome I've watched many tutorials but couldn't watch it till the end, until i found him
kudos to Mike! This video literally is amazing; I learnt the basics ( I am still half way through the video ) I really wish to do something for this guy, I already liked the video and even subscribed to channel (I can't join, I am underage ) what is the different between ++a and a++ ? i did not understand what is the benefit of the second parameter(number) with find function ? Tolkien* "its a good language to learn if you are getting into programming" Thx now i can hack pentagon Hey, does anyone know how to get code blocks for a M1 MacBook I just can't seem to find the file? getline(cin, string) doesnt work ._. Whichever code you have written in this video Can we run the same script in vs code I've finished the 4 hours and now I'm about to start my first project to colonize mars. in 3:35:56 who else spotted an office reference> I thought for the longest time that Mike had shortbhair but got bamboozled at 1:48:44 , Lol Dr. Umoru on youtube has finally cured me of my HSV-2 I don't know how to thank you, truly you are a god sent... the video seems cut earlier than it's supposed to be 31:16 Hmm, que pena. Eu n√£o sei ingl√™s :/. Why is there no intermediate and advanced lessons? You know it gets real when he starts explaining what an IDE is üëç I HAVE A TEST IN 7 HOURS HOPE ILL PASS 45:00 aww this int working with me :/ after installing code blocks theres an error that says entry point not found You're amazing. I'm 14 and I just love programming so much, but it was hard to find where to learn. why would anyone dislike this Couldn't get the IDE you recommended for Mac (too old a version), is CLion okay to use for all of this? 1:04:53 Was that a fucking Haruhi Suzumiya reference?! thank you so much Idk if someone pointed it out in the comments, just will leave this here, 'cause why not :)

1:53:54 Mike writes { ...else if(num2 >= num1 && num2 >= num3)... }, we can just throw away condition with >=num1. The reason is: we already in the first statement looked if num1 is the biggest. If it's not, then we go to this step, right? So we don't need to compare 1 and 2, we have done it before. On that point num1 is not the biggest (or not one of the biggest) and is left sitting in the corner - _-)/ my coding journey
day 1-Hello world - working with numbers 33:25 38:00 3:37:00 why use bool when you can use string function like for example string hasHonors () {
			if (gpa>=4){
		return "He is honored";
				
			} return "Next Year lol";
		}
simple as that not using bool one with ones and zeros thats lame but still man i would like to say thanks to you for your work you awesome 8:44Am enjoying the language already, thanks teacher √ú 2021 goal

It is really very  very  helpful ‚ò∫ cuz hey 2 me  all of us are free to speak whatever language we please  and just cuz  lets say a german couple move to the  u.s.a   they are more than welcome 2 keep speaking their beautiful language if thats wat they want    :) well I'm wanting to acquire the german language just becuz  I too love different languages  and also should i ever meet a german person  that may be home sick 4 their native land  in this case germany i would want to   talk to them not in English  but in their language even if they know english too, i just feel that to me it would show them that i care much about their language to want to start studying it so that they wont feel so  lonely i guess thats what i am meaning. Ich Liebe Deutsch und ich liebe Deutschland auch  :)   yay  hahahaha German alphabet sound almost similiar with Indonesian alphabet sound only far diferent in J V and Y, litle diferent in Q and W sound. But german n Indonesia have realy diferent language The √ú in German sounds like the letter Y in Finnish. That's why it's easy for me to say that letter since i'm also learning Finnish. Thank you‚ù§ The only reason,im learning german is,because, 
YOU UTTTERRRRR FOOOL GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! Danke! Teacher i really Apriciate your lesson (*¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ)ÔæâÔæâ In Indonesia we change j 'yot' with j 'je' (like English version) and change y 'ypsilon' with y 'ye'

Ja (Dutch) = Ya (Indonesia) So basically french pronunciation with english(ish) words? (ee) (yot) (kah) Super like 0:39 People when I do something remotely feminine I came here so I could sing WMID üò≠ now I‚Äôm trying to pronounce ‚ÄòERR‚Äô right but I‚Äôm looking like a fool. I just started learning German and it's a fascinating language. Some of the alphabet is pronounced the same as in French. Makes it a little easier for me. It's cool that the letter Y almost sounds the same as in Italian. German sounds like a mixture of English and French in my opinion. I‚Äôm very late to this and I watched this for review because I have been learning German and you explained stuff way more understandable than me being in a group and not really understanding so thank you!!

Hi everyone, I'm just started to learn German and want to know German grammar. For example Subject+V+Object in English. What about German.?
And Which one is more difficult (French and German)? When German is an aggressive language: https://youtu.be/Oy-cArjg3t0 Its similliar with indonesia waww I love Germany am in Germany I want to learn Thanks, Sunny Su! I've been struggling a lot since I came to Germany and now that I'm repeating 6th Grade here, I'd really like to learn this language since my mom isn't always by my side to teach me Deutsch, having the job of taking care to the people in a Home for The Aged, and because of just that, I,d really like to thank you again! When practicing pronouncing the German alphabet turns into NSFW for me because the pronunciation for I and J is inappropriate in my native language cuz it's like the ASL of F and G. Anyone in my house would probably ask me why I'm saying intercourse so loud not knowing that I'm practicing German üòÇ. I almost started to cry in frustration trying to pronounce "err" üò≠ Is the pronunciation of √º she taught in this correct??? Because Google and other apps are giving different pronunciation for this. Help!!! Hans Thanks I learnt much in this lesson.

1)Keep an organised vocabulary notebook.
2)Look at the words again after 24 hours, after one week and after one month.
3)Read, read, read. ...
4)Use the new words. ...
5)Do word puzzles and games like crosswords, anagrams and word searches.

Please keep up the outstanding work
Please keep up the amazing work. Great The biggest weapon God has comes from a very small book: A Dictionary. The best book I have seen for English learning has been English 3200. It is no longer available. Learning a second language powers the first language. Children in the first five years of life should be exposed to at least two languages. For instance: My brain has visual images (silent) beginning at 8 months of age. The faces, the contortions are all vivid. By knowing two languages, a stroke patient has a better ability to regain speech. A second language powers innate poetry in the original language and the second. A physician in the USA has the secondary largest vocabulary next to a Dictionary Writer. I think my vocabulary is the best in the world since I love Greek, Latin, English and Spanish. I stay away from Chinese. I cannot overload my brain because it rubs negatively against my creativity. Chinese Proverb: A bird sings a song not because it has the answer but because it just wants to sing a song. I began to acquire English at the age of 14. I am very good at it but it took me work. My first poems were like bricks; they lacked flow or continuity. I kept working on it day and night and even hit the bars to write my passion through poetry. Language is truly a science but our English Teachers for the most part don't have the innate intelligence to teach it to us better. My original argument with my English Teacher 1A was: "I need to write English so well that I can conquer the world!" She mocked me. English is a beautiful Language (Those that are bilingual must learn not to intermingle the two except for poetry or a point to make.) I love so much keep going please.

12:37 - Take care! Decided to learn ASL for my half brother who having a hard time speaking my dad decided it's better to just teach him asl not force him to speak if he find it hard so wish me luck im learning asl for 3 reasons:
1: to communicate with deaf people
2: to brag
3: my friends learn this to if we want to talk in private My grandma taught at a deaf school. I used to know words and phrases when I was young that she taught me. I would like to learn again. Thanks bunches üôè im trying learn asl becuz i just saw a video that santa does sign language to a deaf little girl Im learning sign language because of a group they put sign language in their dancing and inspired me to learn, appreciate, and be friends for those who use sign language After having surgery on my hand, something in me wanted to learn sign. Oh the irony. i Work at a grocery store and a few of the customers have been non verbal or deaf, so i‚Äôm learning some more ASL to communicate with them more!! You are so pretty and this is very useful I want to learn asl so if a deaf person comes into my work they won't feel stressed out I am learning because my mom has a deaf co worker and there was a person that knew how to sign but they left so now I am teaching my mom this is so helpful! i'm learning ASL just so that i can talk to deaf people ü•∞ I finally got diagnosed with autism and talking can sometimes be really uncomfortable or impossible for me, I‚Äôm excited to start learning ASL :) What is asl and bsl ? The people in these comments are so sweet! I'mma have diabetes uwu Every deaf person would be able to understand this? I decided to learn this bc there is a new employee where I work and works at my station with me and I wanna learn sign language so I can have convos with him :) he is really cool Thanks so much. This helped a lot! I'm losing my hearing, I'm very close to getting a cochlear implant or hearing aids but still I'm scared of losing my hearing even though it would be quite rare for it to happen. I just wanna make sure I'm able to know how to speak in sign in case of that. Its also a great skill to have. When you finger spelled your name. What sort of T was that? I wasn‚Äôt taught that version. A quiet place made me want to learn this. Oh my goodness, this is awesome, sometimes I have to slow down the speed to check the movements more accurately but it's just perfect. Thank you so much for this utterly educational video, much love from Brazil! im just learning also for my own good , would love to speak to someone and help if needed :) Thank you for sharing!; I'm definitely rewatching this! I'm trying to learn it because i just want to be ablo to communicate even a little bit with deaf people <3 Everyone is learning sign for wholesome reasons, I‚Äôm learning because I want to be able to talk in the wings. *7-8-21*
Just learned it all in one sitting. I will continue learning at my pace.  Thanks a bunch! I love it!!! I am CODA but I am Brazilian. I know the Alphabet, is a start, and just 4 letters are different. Now I want to learn ASL to learn the SIGNS to teach my Mom and to be able to speak with Deaf Americans. Thank you so much! Idk why but after watching silent voice i feel like i must learn sign language trying to learn but its hard when i dont use ASL often. a lady that checks my groceries is deaf so im learning a little to comminucate with her but i can't understand what she says, i just know please thank you and some other basics. is there a resource for someone signing to you and learning what they're saying? God bless you my child . its a great job .. n pray for my doughter . she is less hearing ..üëçüíì i decided to learn it to make friends (also i watched the quiet place and want to be prepared) This thought literally came to me. I suddenly wanna learn SL. I wanna communicate with people, and don't want a language barrier. I want them to feel comfortable. Is it okay if sometimes I don‚Äôt use the right hand for domination things cause I am try to keep all the ones that are supposed to be dominant with my dominant hand but some I keep doing with my left ;-; 
Like what does the dominant and non dominant hand have to do with the sign I guess is what I‚Äôm asking? i'm glad i learned some basic asl as a kid because later on when i went into foster care, i ended up needing it for my 2 foster brothers (both had autism and couldn't speak). i'm relearning now just for fun Thank you I work at hot topic and get a lot of deaf customers and I want to be able to talk to them I always said if i had one wish i woupd know every language so i could make people laugh or happy in a comfortable way. No wishes so i gotta work for it :( She cute u can teach me anything American sign language basics at its best. Keep up the good work I learned ASL in middle school/High School and have slowly stopped remembering most of the signs. although I do remember I, My and You and most of the alphabet I haven't had anybody to practice and conversate with since then. My whole life I've wanted to learn sign language and Spanish. somehow it's gotten away from me. I at least want to know the basics and this video has helped a lot. Uhm for a while I've wanted to learn sign language. Actually I'm not american and I'm not sure my countries own is the same but i really want to learnü•∫it seems like the best language to learn. And i do want to be able to communicate with deaf and dumb people ü•∫ I don't want our communication to be stunted by communication barriers So I hear her keep saying "with your dominant hand"... Is ASL like a guitar that it can be either way or should I start learning with my right as dominant? Very confused... Hey I'm still learning but I'm sure this will help me alot thx Great video Thank u for this needed to learn sign for my friend  who‚Äôs deaf i‚Äôm learning basic sign so that i can speak to a family friend. she can read lips but i think that someone should be able to do the basics with her WOW Watching this because I'm tired of stuttering. Im learning sign language because my teacher keeps getting mad at me for talking to my friends lol(plus I get to make more friends) I'm going to Italy to test this My younger cousin is losing her hearing so I am gonna try to learn sign to be able to talk to her Can someone make a video on how to spell Richie in sign language Wait so what did that sign mean? The one where you asked ‚Äúthis sign means what?‚Äù With one hand in a fist and the other in a flat palm Very easy to understand. This is great! Thank you this helps a lot is there a sign for every word? (except for a name) or are there some things that you may have to spell out im going to a new school and i wanna b able to sign at least a little bit incase theres someone who is mute or deaf at the school so then they could feel like they fit in a little bit :,) 0:35  hello

12:12  see you later 
12:37  take care This is one of the most underrated assets for a server. You may only get a deaf or hard of hearing person rarely, but. Makes their night when you can communicate with them. I want to other polite expresssions on  sign language The Second gesture (Hey!) is how I pick up chicks. Its 2am and im learning Sing Language and also got into Reddit subredit for Deaf peoples... I dont know anyone who is deaf... Cool, now I just need some sign people to practice with I recently made a deaf friend who hate talking because of her voice and always wanted to talk to me in sign so her birthday is coming up in 3 months and I have decided for her gift will be me being able to talk to her in sign. I hope she is happy with her surprise!! Is it important of which hand do I mostly gesture? I‚Äôm having a hard time with the finger positions on ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up‚Äù.   Not sure if I‚Äôm misunderstanding placement, or if it‚Äôs a difficult position for my fingers to be in. What is the difference between "you" pointing index finger and "you" showing palm to the person we talk? i started to watch switched at birth and it made me want to learn sign i started to a couple years ago in school but then switched schools for sure want to learn more. i work with many people in public and some are deaf and communication is key. i am horribly scared id say something bad by accident. so if i can do my part and learn, it should make things easier for everyone. Question: She signed "I" and "You" two different ways. What's the rule here? When do I point and when do I use my whole hand? I trying to learn ASL because I love communication. This language is the way to reach this wonderful people. yes So far, I'm learning more in a day of watching videos then I learned in about 3 years of Middle School Spanish. So Thankful I'll be learning ASL this year, it's a great language. Wow. Sign language actually makes more sense than I thought ü§® i‚Äôm learning asl for my sister who was in a car crash and lost her hearing I‚Äôm gonna warn my deaf friend that I‚Äôm gonna shoot the school Learning this because of a silent voice üòÇ I absolutely love ASL. I wish there was a blind person ASL.Wait...maybe there is. Now down the rabbit hole. I learned basic ASL in the 5th grade as part of the curriculum. I am also deaf in one ear so I have learned reading lips and sit in specific spots when I need to hear something.. I hear darn well considering. I have always wanted to pick up ASL Your video is glorious. Thank you. Add this to the mix of mandarin and spanish and I should be able to communicate with many. Thank you for the excellent videos. You are a champ in my book. Ugh. Not looking forward to french. But I am looking forward to Russian.
So over the decades, I have developed my own sign language witch I have read is not uncommon. Some of the movements are different but they all kind of seem similar. Is that common? Seems like when I use my own homebrew others can understand me pretty well. Do you think it is the facial expressions or the intuitive way deaf people interpret movement and facial expression? Just wanting your thoughts. Everyone in the comments: *Im learning this for a noble reason*
Me: So- I wanna practice drawing hands and this can help me in both ways Thank you, signing is actually easy for me to learn (I'm quite surprised myself) I think i just found a new hobby I'm learning asl for my mom who is losing hearing Why is this so much downvoted? I found it excellent! Is this video mirrored? So I'm learning sign, I went to talk to one of the people at my church, she's deaf, turns out I can sign until my hands hurt, that is until the skill is applicable, then I panic üòÖüòìüòñ I'm learning ASL because I'm autistic and semi-verbal. I'd like a way to communicate when I cannot do so verbally. What if you naturally use your non-dominant hang I'd that ok or a big no nothis  video   is    so  good üëåüèª Love you pakiaala Yo done is that american or british english ? I still don't understand why they bought a new printer 9:20 why he said, 'turn at the second traffic light' instead of 'turn right at the second traffic light' ???? Why at america all kid can speak english when they 3 y old Very good videos pendant

No hay ni una sola frase traducida this video very excellent I hope increase video like this Hello mam ‚ù§Ô∏è Que mal me veo para el listening de ma√±ana I just study English  for three month but I 'm try to listen is it for beginners? really? If you hope that only listening can teach us how to speak I have some bad news: it can‚Äôt and it won‚Äôt. 
Having listened to any recordings we need to work on it further:
- do expertises 
- talk about what we have listened to
- hell, even speaking to yourself can help!
But listening and listening alone will be disappointingly ineffective. Kesini krna disuruh Dosen/Guru Mam can you send the link of your listening lessons of playlist Peal necles Very disgusting I'm so thankful for your help. I like your videos It is grand practice, thanks. It's very helpful for me anyone who don't speak English try it bro it's really helpful 1st I know Speaking and Grammars (not so much) but Listening :/ TOO bad excellent ,create more like these. we r srilankan I don't understand xd my level of english is -10 Good.....I really appreciate ur this practice.....it has helped me to know my level.... i like this way to learn english Yay i . Can  answer Really really this is Lucy is very good fun and fantastic it give me a lot of benefits for real and they love it and I hope that everyone wants to develop himself in English language keep listening and keep reading and keep writing and keep reading and keep speaking in the same time and be affectionate to this English language and be optimistic I don‚Äôt be pessimistic and do allowed to nobody destroyed you as you know there is a lot of people are vengeful and a lot of people are hopelessness so don‚Äôt allow to hopelessness and operation in circles you just be hopeful be successful be pissed If you want to escape from latam, you need at least to learn English. please help me,i am from azerbaijan,i dont understand listning and listning to tak examüôè Enjoyed this video? Please vote for me as the Top Programming Guru. It takes only a second and your support means a lot to me: https://bit.ly/2G7tf2s hey mosh iam asking one question we can use code editor best for vs code ? You deserve a like Sir.. Where is oops is the download for mac coz its not working iin windows dmg file Incredible. what you have done is a great job! and its your years of experience that you are sharing with everyone else for free!.awesome! and thanks Excellent teacher! The way you say beautiful and your smile ‚ò∫ why do u use byte quite often instead of int ? is it to save memory? Can someone send to me the cheat sheat? The page has being deleted. Can someone who have it upload via google drive or something? Hey Mosh, how do you create your animations? They are looking awesome! Why have you removed the cheatsheat? I think you made a mistake at 2:21:29
You wrotte to decrement
// for (int i = (fruits.length)  ; i > 0 ; i--)
System.out.println(fruits[i]);
 Index 3 out of bounds for length 3

After some minutes: 
solution
//for (int i = (fruits.length)-1  ; i >= 0 ; i--)
System.out.println(fruits[i]);

GREAT TUTORIAL!!
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!! Great video, Mosh! Does anyone know what application he uses for the visuals? :) egg head You did not explain how to install intelliJ in windows and it is so complicated, it is some options during installing but you did not explain them :/ Watching this video to learn java 14 hours before my Semester exam, wish me luck Can anyone tell me. Does this video contents full java course or not??üôÑ Absolutely enjoyed your tutorial and so proud of you as an Iranian. 1:03:05 pi in a sense of pee? xD hahaha that's funny Sir, you are the rarest gem in the whole world....Thank you so much. You have started the career of many people.... Sir please create java snake game.and make video sir Awesome video! Kudos to you Mosh! Hello sir!!
This is mani kanya.. I don't know any programming knowledge.. I saw ur Java programming course.. How great teacher ur üôèüôè.. Thank you üòä Great Sir 49:06 1:07:02 bodmas Can we use vs code studio for jdk??? Hello Mosh, first of all thanks for the tutorial. I really appreciate that you speak slowly so non english speakers (like me) can understand better. Also I hope you can check the cheatsheet link since it's broken Java ‚òï {
system.out.print("Thanks mosh");
} man, im blessed to have this video. The only way for this to be better is to give exercises This java basics couse is helpfull !!! i really learnt java nicely by this thanks a lot
you have did a lot of work to do editing of this video also GREAT COURSE. Loving the simplification  <3
The "cheat sheet" link doesn't work! :( 1:15:04 lol I thought you were gonna take an actual math class. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLE_8RVpZds&t=8s very interesting and easy tutorial. thankx very much you are my idol ;) are java is artificially written by some app ???? ok Your cheat sheet site isn't opening mosh. Please help. 45:33 (bookmark) Will you continue this series? Interesting, concerning the FizzBuzz project, I didn't know about modulus, so ended up using double x != (int) x to define if it's a fraction or not. Worked perfectly but coding was a bit longer. Thanks so much for this course, extremely helpful for beginners like me I did not understand 41:15 till 41:56 , can someone explain please? https://youtu.be/Z44MkSF6ejc You the man Mosh! thanks. I like this video. very nice I watched your python tutorial, the 6 and a half hour one, and made quite a few python projects. I really appreciate the effort you put into these videos, really helpful. Why is (double)10/(double)3 = 3.33333333333335?
1:04:48 Where's the next stage course after this? Thank you can we do this tutorials in java eclipse Thanks üëçüèºüëçüèº Thanks aa lot may you live long Nice for beginners Anyone has the Java cheat sheet? Because when i open it it says "This page couldn‚Äôt be found". not sure hes guna get much ad revenue if its only his own video ads playing on his video And now I have to retake my java exam this guy feels like someone you'd trust on your drink with at a party when you about to vomit Thanks Mosh for publishing this nice tutorial. It's really helpful for a new Java learner like me. :) I just wanna Thankyou for making this course ! , just completed the course and I loved it <3 Heartfully Thanking u sir bcoz we r getting this all for free I feel like programming is like martial arts........or going to the gym..........LOADS of people have the idea and desire to do it and may even have dabled in it just a little bit......but have been put off by the amount of hard work that has to go into it. How can I download the source code for the mortgage calculator? review 1:37:14 and below. note to self :P awesome video, apricate it IMO a better solution to the FizzBuzz problem - no repetition, no nested if's
        int getal = 0;
        String antwoord = "";
        System.out.print( "Voer een getal in: " );
        getal = scan.nextInt();
        if (getal % 5 == 0)
            antwoord += "Fizz";
        if (getal % 3 == 0 )
            antwoord += "Buzz";
        System.out.println( antwoord.length()==0 ? getal : antwoord );

Perhaps my C/C++ borreling up :-) Hello My application is not working in microsoft edge browser while transferring file.. Anyone have idea how to fix it 1:03:00 Don't feel ashamed. Only the Anglos say "Py". In the rest of the world, it's "Pee", which is indeed how it should be pronounced in the language of its origin, namely (classical) Greek. Too bad for the Anglos it means something awkward in their lingo. They have the same problem with "Uranus" LOL if im using a chromebook spin 311 which file should i download Nice Give him Nobel award for his work helping tech society, he is a good man :-)
Thank you so much. Anyone using the Point Class, 
package com.avishek;

import java.awt.Point;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
            Point first=new Point(1,1);
            System.out.println(first);


    }
} ÿπÿßŸÑ€å didnt learn shit, 0/10 Mosh, you're the best! Anyone who is absolutely new to programming and is watching this, I recommend watching Mosh's python tutorial (8hr one) first, not because python is easier than java but watching that tutorial will give you some what introduction to classes and functions etc so you can learn them separately and peacefully without  being bombarded with all lot of terms you have heard first time.
I also recommend Head Java First to help you understand java in a fun way 2:00:58 Guys what is application file please help i am an incoming cs student. This thing would be a big help, kudos to all part of this video! Man u r really doing a great job keep doing it . My learning is only through ur videos ur a genius Alternate to FizzBuzz: System.out.println("Many Thanks for your video!");

   public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number;
        Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Number: ");
        number = myScanner.nextInt();

        if ((number % 5) == 0)
            System.out.print("Fizz");

        if ((number % 3) == 0)
            System.out.print("Buzz");

        if (((number % 3) == 0) || (number % 5) == 0)
            System.out.println(""); // new line after Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz
        else
            System.out.println(number);
    } Really annoyed due to these ads, its coming again and again after a few minutes.
:( I love this guy he‚Äôs sooooo good at explaining and legit it‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt care a fuck he really wants to teach you hey thre shortcut that you showed for writing "System.out.println", so I entered sout, and pressed TAB, but doesn't work.
Pls help. Thankyou very much for this tutorial! Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type. In Java, there are two types of casting: Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size. byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double. mosh you are a gift to programmers , plz make a video on spring framework & spring boot also very very nice ,best ,classy , great video on java ,with other instructors time doesn't go at all ,  with mosh time flies as mosh does his magic . How Many languages you know before you born? mosh where is the mortgage calculator source code, you mentioned its attached below the video Awesome tutorial. I had to break the video down into three sessions. Previous experience in other languages sped things up but now I know a few basics about Java. There is still much to learn and I know nothing; just a beginner. Thank you very much . When I thought of coding I thought it would be very hard but you make it easy üòéüòéüî• respect 10:40 In Java 16 it says com.company. Is this the same as com.package that Mosh explains? O.M.G this video help me to understand java more than 4 long years in my university :))) Thank you for this video ŸÖŸàÿ¨ŸàÿØŸäŸÜ ÿπÿ±ÿ® ŸáŸàŸÜÿü 43:27

Thanks üòä paying for c lessons is stupid, you can just watch this man explain every little thing you gotta know and you're set, everything at no cost Thanks a lot for this course it helped me learn the basics. 29:00 continue tommorrow from here I did this using one if else statement after a while loop...

Is it true? 
int main()
{
    int luckynumber=5;
    int input;
    int guesscount=0;
    int guesslimit=3;
    while( (input != luckynumber)&& (guesscount<guesslimit)){

PLS REPLY
LOVE FROM INDIA You need to add a clurse on ¬´¬†Malbolge for beginners¬†¬ª hehehe At 32:00 ish. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to say %i since it‚Äôs an integrer instead of using %d (double)? Or does it not matter? God bless you, you're a perfect teacher.. Sir, Can I get notes of the tutorial u taught?
If, yes where can I get?..
Thanks 12th grade CS portion within 4hrs....why not ! Mike Dane is the best..Thank you!!üòäüòä Can you reduce your talking speed Guys today i uploaded a video of my own teaching the most easiest program u can check it out! :) Ithenth manga char color[20];
  char anyword[20];
  char name[20];


  printf("Enter a Color:");
  scanf("%s",color);
  printf("Enter Anyword:");
  scanf("%s",anyword);
  printf("Enter the Name:");
  fgets(name, 20, stdin);



  printf("Roses are %s\n",color);
  printf("%s are blue\n",anyword);
  printf("I Love %s",name);


i tried it like this but didnt get the output correctly.
can we  use  fgets and scanf in the same program?

please tell me what was the error.  :) I studied C through another resource awhile ago. I am trying to refresh on it and this was by far the best basics run of C. Thank you so much! Just a quick question if someone can help. During the variables tutorial I keep getting invalid initializer for the int variable. I've double and triple checked it and it was written exactly as the example but it still would not run. Was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on it I tried to download different IDE for my mac but all of them keep saying won't work and requires update...., what can I do? Did he say that comments should be limited, as best practice?? Maybe he's talking about simple programs, where little explanation is needed. Within large complex programs, having comments to explain what's trying to be achieved can be save a lot of headaches and time, especially when the program is defective - where the code doesn't represent what's trying to be achieved. No1 Hey programmers!
This is Niamulhqe from 23/06/2021!
If your in this time and thinking which version to download of code block download -
"" codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe "" or simply use our VSC to code :D How to add many files under same project main...cos i dont want to keep creating many project ..i want to save many  "main " files with different file names ..please help me out hello mike, so i tried to create a file using this code  FILE * fpointer = fopen("klinks.txt","w");. I also closed the file. But i could not see the text  file.  instead it is creating a main.exe and a main.o file. i do not know why. Please help!!! I am a middle age woman who is trying to figure out what to do with my life after raising my 3 children. As I was taking CS50, my confidence dwindled, but this course did more than recovering my lost confidence. Thank you so much, you are such a fabulous teacher!! C programming using Android :- https://youtu.be/b72d9nIZCTk This tutorial was really good, thank you! Your desktop background blinds me. A little bit to basic for me Thank you so much this helped me immensely.

P.S : I can tell you are an "Office" fan from the struct section :p. I thought it was never possible t√≥ remove sectext virus but WAPTECS make it possible and faster Thank you Mike! Done finishing the tutorial after 2 weeks.. I'm working while studying c language. I'll try to create a program using C.

It's my favourite channel to learn english easier They don't like anymals. √ë √ë √ë √ë How did get to canada? Are you student or do you live as asylum seeker.üôèüôè When the mind remained under the sky of monotony, the blood of culture froze in the arteries of contemplation, and the forces of thinking grew old, and the luster of literary stagnation eroded, and the passers by lost their way back to the seat of wisdom  and guidance.
 Would the steps of the decline towards the depth of failure proceed without the speculative fiction sensors being lethargic to go deeply to read the current situation with the eyes of science?
 There is no doubt that joining the list of cultural distinction many tools in order for awareness to be able to overcome the most current obstacles in order to reach a sure solution to the existing and complex problems.
 In order not to remain confined to the circle of literary apathy
 we must push for a return to the historical word, and here I mean going back to the books to founding the pure mind, so that we do not merge into the furnace of contemporary modernity and get lost from our tongues all the wonderful alphabets.

üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè I am a teacher in USA. I came here in my 45+ as a math teacher, I was very studious student but I was from Hindi medium, since I was a pro in Math, I got a teaching job here and I servived because I could understand and speak, but it wasn't fluent like native people. I lacked in speaking fluent English. It was my dream. So sir, I promise you that within 6 months I will be a pro in spoken English too, thanks to you :) Sir please come back, we are badly missing youüôè I always wants to  comment for your videos , but I didn't, because of my sentence formation in English is not good at all   . But today after seeing this video. I felt like today it is time to do comment . Very useful video for me thank you so much sir You are a very good proffesor. I am been impressed about the clear explanations of you basic grammar videos: clear and to the point. I gave up trying to learn it for years but its absolutely necessary, since it was not clearly explained to me.It helps a lot
whith my  mistakes. Is there a following order of you videos. Like lessons in a teaching book.? 
Thanks a lot for your help¬° Thank you, sir Good evening teacher,So could you please teach me about comma and . in English language?I am Cambodia so i hope that you will teach me from Den from Cambodia. Hi, I have checked many, I would say hundreds of sentences in English and the preposition ON is
very frequent, but I frequently use IN, instead of ON, since my mother language is Spanish and the IN
 , EN in Spanish, is very frequently used.  Is there any rule or cases to use ON. It not always means ON
The top of something instead inside of something like IN the drawer ON the table, but ON the sidewalk or IN the street, that every book mentions, but are hundreds more uses. Do I have to memorize it all?
Thanks for your help. Thank you sir Thanks a lot sir Sir I like your videos So Cool Sounds phenomenal
The way you pronounce those of your video sir...

*itadakimasu* Japanese have three Scripts
1. Hiragana
2. Katakana
3.Kanji
The main differences are that hiragana is used for phonetically spelling out Japanese words, and katakana is for foreign words. ... Kanji is not a phonetic syllabary. Instead it is a set of characters that represent whole words. mee Wow this is kinda easy now, I have a tip for u guys if you want to learn, you can listen too this (without looking) and try to spell the non Kanji ones on paper, It helped me lol Jaoanese is the best and very easy 6:44 Oh my flipping lord how much japanese do I have to write in my sketchbook (nobody is forcing me im actually forcing myselfüòÇ) Who else is taking notes üìù

 subscribers This instructor is awesome. Really does a good job of explaining the concepts. The language, the delivery of the speech - everything makes it an interesting video to watch, along the with the content itself. Very high quality tutuorial How much time will it take if i dedicate 2hrs daily with concentration to learn it completely till advanced level if there is  any ?

I am very passionate about this and specially in neural networks .

Please tell me ? I am currently in class 9th but i have completed class 9 and 10 th maths and science completely.
Currently i am studying Physics and Maths of  class-11 th.
I am really interested in learning Artificial Intelligence.
Please tell me where to start learning ? 
Is it necessary to complete 11th and 12th maths for learning AI ? Please tell me this  question is stopping me from learning ? I have learned Python . Wonderful course. I learned so much with it. Thank you very much !  "Predicted sentiment: Extremely Positive" :-D Where I can find the code used in this tutorial. Awesome explanation.. nice course.. and good introduction to the AI, ML.  Nice job by the tutor Thank you miss, i m just entered in the field of AI and getting more interest as i can understand it well through EDUREKA. 
But most probably questions generated in my mind is is AI got emotions or it became corrupted then I think this will be the beginning of destruction of Human Life.... And mostly it is also mentioned by Stephens Hawkins.... Can we get the code of examples used in video ? Heartiest gratitude to edureka for sharing such an amazing tutorial! 
Is it permitted to use your tutorials while making a slide presentation for education purposes? Amazing lecture, thank you for posting such a valuable course over YouTube. Useful videos . One note: a large chunk of this course is about knowledge discovery. Machine Learning is a subset of that. edureka! thank you! give as the powerpoint presention file Mam Can I get full course in online if it is possible means from where can I get it please respond me mam My one stop video for kick starting my AI journey! Thanks for the content and creators!. Please share the demo code if possible.

As a hearing person I am disappointed in the response from the channel after reading the comments section.  However,  instead of not doing anything we can help take this down by reporting this video as misleading to Google.
Pls do this if possible.  Let's stop this injustice to our deaf friends!


After reporting the video it would be great if u would leave a comment showing your support! I don't know anyone deaf but what's the harm if me learning sign language can help someone specially abled mmmmmmmm and I don't know what I did Thank GOD a community of ASL people are here!

I learned "I love you" from the a quiet placee This video should be deleted I didn't look at the comments before I started memorizing, but I'm glad I saw some other videos before this. I thought something was fishy when the "mother" sign was different from what I've seen. its my pleasure to meet you Victoria I‚Äôm  deaf! I like ASL! ASL errors:

Mother (she signed grandmother)
Father (she signed grandfather)
Family ( ‚ÄúBSL‚Äù sign for ‚Äúfamily‚Äù is ASL for ‚Äúfamily‚Äù)
I am fine (I don‚Äôt know if that counts)
I am good (correct sign of ‚Äúgood‚Äù: 1:31)
Facebook (We don‚Äôt really have a sign for that so we spell ‚ÄúFB‚Äù)
YouTube (No. I‚Äôm les. Please don‚Äôt do that sign for YouTube)
Instagram (We spell ‚ÄúIG‚Äù)

I'm not fluent in asl although I definitely know the basics and all of these were COMPLETELY WRONG!! This is spreading misinformation and totally offensive to the deaf community. This is horrible to see Please take this down! The signs are inaccurate That's completely wrong. Take this down now, it‚Äôs wrong, please do NOT learn from this not sure for that. This is wrong. I'm not learning of those. I'm hard of hearing and sign language. no. this not how works! *take this down now this isn't you need it!*

WoW Thanks üôèüèª I have a question what is the difference between g and p ? What is the dif btwn ASL& BSL? She was signing alphabet to quick for me to catch up It is wonderful Quick question. Does it matter if you do the signs with the left or right hand?
I am a lefty and have been learning the basics, but noticed that I use my left hand to memorize them. Thank you for your efforts
Please, can you give me a list of static(without movement) words of American Sign Language?
Thank you in advance Wait a second I learned really little asl from deaf people and the ones I know are all correct Anyone else did a facepalm after seeing this? She signed GRANDMA and GRANDPA, and the FAMILY incorrectly!!! She I'm so sad, I memorized most of them and then I read the comments. Oh God!! I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs deaf üßèüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I don‚Äôt know why I like learning sign language ü§üüèª I really enjoy it I feel like I‚Äôm doing an amazing thing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is ASL and BSL? I learn ASL with my dad he is not deaf but he know it because of his friends I talk sign also xD I only know this by reading the comments , ( thank you for them ) but uhh these are wrong , don‚Äôt memorise them please Please, if you are learning asl, DONT use this source, a lot of her signs were wrong or nonexistent. Take this down! It is incorrect So I‚Äôm not apparently deaf but I do want to learn it to help some people who ARE deaf like my other lunch lady so I can talk to her<3 Guys just saying shes saying aunt and uncle in the thumnail Some of them are wrong !!! Honestly I memorised one or two for the family and as soon as I read the comments... Disgusting. These are not correct, I have been learning asl Assholes!!! That's all WRONG!!! i was just about to comment to ask something but as i was reading comments of others.. i almost learn from a wrong channel. please if you are not a pro at sign language don't do a tutorial about it many migh learn from this.
