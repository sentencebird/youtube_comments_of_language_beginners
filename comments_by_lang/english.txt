Thanks a lot man (guru) 🙏🙏 Not even quarter of the way through this. I’m learning a lot and actually managing to keep my attention on it instead of the normal span of a goldfish. Trying to learn coding to use in a very ambitious project I’m doing with my car 😊 Am I the only 13 year old just doing this as a summer hobby? Is this course a complete one like the course in the Mosh official website or missing any thing ? For full course , do we need to buy from the site or this will be enough ? The cheat pdf link that I received in mail does not load Very helpful. It is amazing I don't have any coding knowledge really, should I start with Python? or is there something newer already after what is your name?
